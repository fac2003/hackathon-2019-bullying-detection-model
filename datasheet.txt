0 I am thinking about transferring to NCF.  Anyone go there?I live in florida and I have never even heard of it. That most likely is a bad sign.Probably not. It has the best reviews from Princeton Review. It's an all honors college with only about 700 kids.i don't go there but i live in sarasota and it is practically down the street, a lot of kids from my school went there. it is a very good school and very very liberal. and the grading system is completly different. good choice if you ask me.    Hey, thank you so much. I don't live down there or no anyone, but it just looked pretty hip.yeah that is deffinetly what is known for around here. i actually had a science teacher that had graduated from there ( he was like 26 or 27) and he loved it. good luck!It seems like I get the same sort of response from people who went there saying they loved it and it was completely different than any other school.  I'll have to look into this other grading scale system tomorrow when I talk to them.Hip is good.. very good.  Sounds like a good place.

1 More and more companies are moving to cheaper countries like Slovenia, Poland, China, India, because the manpower is cheaper there. At the beginning it was low qualified jobs, it was not looking so "dangerous". But now, it is skilled jobs too.  Soon, we wont have any jobs left in the rich countries : the work will be done in eastern Europe or in Asia . Sounds very bad.You know I hear a similiar complaint here in Asia EXCEPT they are complaining about losing management and other high paid positions to Americans and Europeans.  In all honesty, it's still in our benefit.  They do the labor, we make the profit.  All this means is our economies will turn more and more service related.  This could have long term military reprecusions but economically this is actually beneficial for us.  Think of it this way.  We pay some one in Taiwan 50 cents to make a pair of Nike's.  We slap our name brand on it and sell it at stores in China for $80.  Now, who is really making out there?   I have thought about the long term result of this and I can see an actual socialist economy that would function properly from this where the corporate wealth is taxed and distributed amongst our populace, all being leveraged up by foreign labor.I would say the owners of  Nike.  Not the everyday worker.you gotta love NAFTA and the WTO... its funny how our economy is going down the tubes and yet the government continues to let those millions of jobs stay out of the country... and your right, its just going to snowball straight into hell if our leadership doesnt take actionWhat's our unemployment rate?  What's our real GNI Per capita?  What's our real median income per capita?  So WTF DO YOU MEAN IT'S GOING DOWN THE TUBE?  WE ARE FUCKING RICH!  Stop whinning you spoiled fucking ignorant american trash!  I have a driver.  He is married and has a daughter.  I pay him $70 a month.  That is up from the $35 we started him out on.  I like him so I gave him a raise.  We have 2 maids.  We are paying them $35 a month.  Norway and Luxembourg are the ONLY two countries in the entire fucking world with a higher per capita income.  REAL income, only luxembourg.  The gap between America and the developed countries has steadily increased over the last 20 years as the other developed countries were stupid enough to cave in to socialist pressures more than we were.  We hit a recession in 2001.  It lasted a whole fucking 2 months before we borrowed our way out of it (god I love war economies).  During that time our real income per capita declined.  It took 2 more years for things to shift back towards growth.  The last 3 years we had very strong economic growth.  Even right now with all the scare of a recession we are sporting a 3% real annual GDP growth, higher than the EU, Japan, Canada, and Australia.  So I will summarize again.  We are the richest country in the world in total and per capita (luxembourg is like 400k people or some shit like that, it doesn't really count imo) and we are getting richer.  For the last 3 years our real GDP growth has matched the world growth.  If you know anything about economic convergence you would understand why this is incredible in itself.  We are rich and getting richer and you stupid spoiled fucks want to bitch.Where is the profit when the americans see their jobs going abroad ? The benefits go to the companies, not to the american people.  The usa are very rich, but the unemployment rate is higher because jobs are going abroad.  Average salary in the US may be high, but the life is expensive there too. And the riches are not distributed equally between the people : you got one guy earning 10,000 dollars a month and next to him a guy with nothing. In average it is 5,000 , but in reality that sucks !  (ps nobody care about your private life and if you hire slaves to clean your house.)That's Capitalisam for you. It is based on the fact that somebody must be riped-off so that other may have more. It has nothing to do with justice, morality, national pride or loyalty. Capitalisam is an individual fight where everything goes.Apparently you did not read what I said.  MEDIAN INCOME PER CAPITA.  We have the third highest real median per capita.  America is cheaper than the UK, France, Germany, Norway, Australia, Japan, ect and we earn a higher income than all of those places (except norway but it's higher after you adjust for cost of living).  The disparity between the rich and poor in America is increasing, although it is still lower than most developed nations, but not because the poor are getting poor but simply because the growth of the middle class is lower than the growth of the upper class.  This should not be surprising.  WTF are you talking about our unemployment rate?  We are around 5% unemployment.  That's not "bad".  That's historically quite a bit below average.  The only developed nation that is having better employment than us is Australia (I don't count Japan because it's actually hindering their economy) and that's because they have such a small population but a relatively large land base.Isn't the US unemployment rate a false statistic?  As far as i know It only shows the people claiming benefits, not the total people who are out of work.  Im no economist Indonesia, but the middle class growth your talking about, surely if the pattern continues that most jobs are outsourced to other nations then wouldn't the middle class will begin to stifle? That $80 dollar nike shoe thats sold in China is also sold in the US. People need well paid jobs to have disposable income. The more disposable income the more sales of branded products are possible. If industrial jobs keep going abroad for cheaper labour, then the less cash people have at home to keep the whole thing ticking over. How are people supposed to buy $80 shoes, when jobs keep going abroad?

0 Hillary got creamed by Obama.  That made me smile.  Agreed.Another great speech. Boy I'd love to see a split ticket...Paul-Obama.           .......................And Bill Clinton. Which is why Ted Kennedy is endorsing Barack and not Hillary.If he's assassinated I'm disowning America.It also fits Plato's Allegory of the Cave.I don't know about the attmpt being successful security is insane now. I met a retired secret service agent he spent 40 minutesÂ explaining the security measures that he Could tell me about.He actually jumped on reagan when that guy tried to kill him.
0 'Creepy gnome' terrorising Argentinian town - video Wednesday, March 12, 2008  Residents of a small town in Argentina have been spooked after several sightings of bizarre-looking figure that was captured on video in the middle of the night.  Locals claim the 'creepy gnome' stalks the streets at night. The little 'person' who wears a pointy hat has a distinctive sideways walk was caught on video last week by youngsters who claim to have been terrified.  Teenager Jose Alvarez - who filmed the figure on his mobile phone - told national newspaper El Tribuno that they discovered the creature while playing in their hometown of General Guemes.  "We were chatting about our last fishing trip. It was one in the morning. I began to film a bit with my mobile phone while the others were chatting and joking.  "Suddenly we heard something - a weird noise as if someone was throwing stones.  "We looked to one side and saw that the grass was moving.  This image, taken by an Argentinan teenager on his mobile, shows what appears to be a gnome-like figure walking a   This image, taken by an Argentinan teenager on his mobile, shows what appears to be a gnome-like figure walking a   "To begin with we thought it was a dog but when we saw this gnome-like figure begin to emerge we were really afraid. I filmed a little and soon all we left running." said Jose.  According to Jose others have now come forward reporting that they too had seen the gnome.    "This is no joke. We are still afraid to go out - just like everyone else in the neighborhood now.  "One of my friends was so scared after seeing that thing that we had to take him to the hospital."   Last October two workers on Belgrano railway line in Buenos Aires reported seeing a "strange and tiny figure". They claim the figure appeared at night, threw stones at them then ran away leaving a 'vapour trail' that 'burned the grass'.         1 of 1  Enlarge This image, taken by an Argentinan teenager on his mobile, shows what appears to be a gnome-like figure walking a field.   What the fuck is this thing?I say that the whole thing is a fucking stunt which the kids in the video may or may not be in on and that 'the gnome' is some midget or child with a pointed hat.It loks like midget to me.  Move along, nothing to see here folks.  Next!

WRONG! Bush did everything he could to make sure that we can't leave for a very long time. That wasn't a mistake.'Make the lie simple, keep repeating it, and eventually the will believe it.' - Hitler. well saidIran is not a friend to the US.

0 ill believe it when i see it  Hillary Clinton's campaign says it is on track to raise $10 million online in the 24 hours since the Pennsylvania primary results were announced.  "Senator Clinton's game-changing victory last night has turned the tide and resulted in an historic outpouring of grassroots support," Clinton Campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. "Just like Hillary, our supporters have met every challenge and come through each time. Thanks to them, we will have the resources needed to compete and win as we move ahead to the next contests."  The campaign also said over 60,000 donors â 50,000 of them new â have given money to Clinton from Tuesday night through noon Wednesday.Since these donations are made public knowledge, wouldn't it be kind of stupid to lie about it?Yes, I posted this earlier., It is unsurprising, that after a win donations go up. And why would you see her $10 mill? lolI'm not saying that they are lying,but do you honestly trust anything coming from Hillary's camp?  Case by case basis; things like this? Yeah.I heard she owes a heck of a lot of money.  Some places are refusing to cater her events because she has produced a nasty reputation of not paying. Some college was all set to sue her. Oh, I don't know. Something about sniper fire? A kitchen sink strategy?Hey I am a blue collar worker, and I support Obama, and I am white am I a dichotomy. Also I am an evangelical Christian and a young person. I am the average Obama supporter no. Hillary thinks all blue collars will vote for her give me a freakin break.

I don't know if the mistake is the reporter's or if someone at Camp Hillary was spinning a bit too fast, but there's no way they raised that much since her win in Pennsylvania yesterday.  An email from Terry McAuliffe, Clinton campaign chairman, that I received three hours ago, says "More than 50,000 people have contributed to the campaign for the very first time in the last 24 hours alone." If 80% of Clinton's donations are from new givers, that implies a total number of about 60,000 donations. If we're very generous and assume an average donation of $100, which is high for first-time donors, that gives Clinton a current take of at most $6 million.  Reading the Post's report from its Trail blog, which was by Matthew Mosk, it looks like the over-spin came from Hassan Nemazee, a finance co-chair for Clinton and longtime Democratic fatcat. A Google search shows Nemazee fed the same line to Business Week, which cited him for the news that Clinton supposedly took in $10 million by 2pm this afternoon.  Why am I bothering to knock this particular claim down to size? Because 90% of politics is about perception, and if a campaign is perceived to be running out of money, or floating in money, that affects what other people will think and do about it. Internet-driven fundraising is an amazing thing, because the costs are so low and the speed so seemingly instantaneous. But anyone who reports on it should be careful to remember that the campaigns can easily hype these numbers, and by the time anyone checks for the truth it won't matter.  The same is true, by the way, for the Obama campaign, as Patrick Ruffini has shown that the Obama campaign's online widget showing its donor total has occasionally behaved in odd ways. The best solution to this problem of verifiability, and the lack thereof, would be real-time donation transparency, as was practiced by the Ron Paul campaign. Unfortunately, that's hardly likely from a major campaign any time soon.  [If you're reading this story because of a link from the HuffPost or Fark.com, I've updated my reporting here. It looks like Clinton did rake in $10M as of sometime late yesterday, based on a claimed total of 100,000 donations since Tuesday night.}
0  White House: North Korea Assisted Syria On Nuclear Reactor Destroyed By Israel   White House: Syria Must 'Come Clean' About Nukes (2:27 min.)  Web Extra: U.S. Intel Video Cites N.K., Syria Link (11:50 min.)  Bush Administration Opens Up About Israeli Airstrike On Syrian Reactor WASHINGTON (CBS News) â The White House said Thursday that North Korea's secret work on anuclear reactor with Syria was "a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the world," raising doubts aboutPyongyang's intention to carry through with a promised disclosure ofits nuclear activities.  Sevenmonths after Israel bombed the reactor, the White House broke itssilence and said North Korea assisted Syria's secret nuclear programand that the destroyed facility was not intended for "peacefulpurposes."  The disclosure could undermine six-party negotiationsto try to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea. The WhiteHouse issued a two-page statement after lawmakers were given detailsabout the reactor in a series of briefings on Capitol Hill. The WhiteHouse said the International Atomic Energy Agency also was beingbriefed on the intelligence.  While calling North Korea's nuclearassistance to Syria a "dangerous manifestation" of Pyongyang's nuclearweapons program and its proliferation activities, the U.S. said itremained committed to the talks.  The administration said that after the reactor was damaged beyond repair, Syria tried to bury evidence of its existence.  "Thiscover-up only served to reinforce our confidence that this reactor wasnot intended for peaceful activities," White House press secretary DanaPerino said. "The Syrian regime must come clean before the worldregarding its illicit nuclear activities."  CIA Director MichaelHayden, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and NationalSecurity Adviser Stephen Hadley briefed lawmakers, who were shown avideo presentation of intelligence information that the administrationcontends establishes a strong link between North Korea's nuclearprogram and the bombed Syrian site. It included still photographs thatshowed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant andthe one near Yongbyon.  According to officials familiar with thepresentation, it did not show moving images inside the facility or anyNorth Korean workers, but included photographs that depict similaritiesbetween the North Korean and Syrian reactor designs.  U.S.negotiators have been trying hard to close a deal in which North Koreawould admit to and give up all its nuclear activities in return forbeing taken off the list of countries that support terrorism, reportsCBS News national security correspondent David Martin.  But atthe same time, the administration had all the photos showing NorthKorea was secretly helping Syria build a reactor that could produceplutonium for nuclear weapons, adds Martin. The images include a photothat U.S. intelligence says shows the head of Syria's nuclear agencywith one of the North Koreans who was negotiating with the UnitedStates.  By making the photos public, Martin reports, the U.S. istelling North Korea: "If you won't come clean, we'll come clean foryou."  The Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by Israeli jets waswithin weeks or months of being functional, a top U.S. official toldThe Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of thesensitivity of the matter. The official said the facility was mostlycompleted but still needed significant testing before it could bedeclared operational.  No uranium, which is needed to fuel areactor, was evident at the site, a remote area of eastern Syria alongthe Euphrates River. But the U.S. official said the reactor was similarin design to a North Korean reactor at Yongbyon, which has in the pastproduced small amounts of plutonium, the marterial needed to makepowerful nuclear weapons.  Top members of the House IntelligenceCommittee said the reactor posed a serious threat of spreadingdangerous nuclear materials.  "This is a serious proliferationissue, both for the Middle East and the countries that may be involvedin Asia," said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.  Hoekstra andIntelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the Bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  "It'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public," Hoekstra said.  President Bush'sfailure to keep Congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for Bush's policies toward North Korea and Syria,he said.  "It totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and Congress," Hoekstra said. "I think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with" regardingNorth Korea.  A senior administration said the White House wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe Middle East region, reports CBS News White House correspondent MarkKnoller.  "We feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly Syria might feel greater pressure to react," the official said.  The White House also stressed that North Korea's assistance on the Syrian reactor was an issue of "great international concern."  "Theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world," Perino said inthe statement. "This is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  "The United Statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region."You mean like North Korea "Came Clean"?Why come clean,, Iraq came clean with inspectors and they submitted every bit of evidence with a 1000 pages that it was not in pocession of WMDs, yet it was meaningless in the goal to invade the sovereign nation anyway. This come clean nonsense is all political rhedoric to appease stupid people who support policies of an aggressive preemtive nature and dont want the truth.I think the White House need to "Come Clean" about nukes first. Pete:  I have had discussions with one of the iraqi inspectors - who is fluent in Arabic. He is fluent enough that he gets paid to do translations. He is also a friend of a close friend.  He said that Iraq DID have WMD's, that they hid information, that they had spies int he inspection teams, that they knew when the inspectors were coming. Inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  The truth in Syria is that North Korea was working with Syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the U.S. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. That agreement was worked out by one Jimmy Carter under the auspices of the Clinton administration. The North Koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning.

Hoekstra andIntelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the Bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  "It'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public," Hoekstra said.  President Bush'sfailure to keep Congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for Bush's policies toward North Korea and Syria,he said.  "It totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and Congress," Hoekstra said. "I think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with" regardingNorth Korea.  A senior administration said the White House wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe Middle East region, reports CBS News White House correspondent MarkKnoller.  "We feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly Syria might feel greater pressure to react," the official said.  The White House also stressed that North Korea's assistance on the Syrian reactor was an issue of "great international concern."  "Theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world," Perino said inthe statement. "This is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  "The United Statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region."You mean like North Korea "Came Clean"?Why come clean,, Iraq came clean with inspectors and they submitted every bit of evidence with a 1000 pages that it was not in pocession of WMDs, yet it was meaningless in the goal to invade the sovereign nation anyway. This come clean nonsense is all political rhedoric to appease stupid people who support policies of an aggressive preemtive nature and dont want the truth.I think the White House need to "Come Clean" about nukes first. Pete:  I have had discussions with one of the iraqi inspectors - who is fluent in Arabic. He is fluent enough that he gets paid to do translations. He is also a friend of a close friend.  He said that Iraq DID have WMD's, that they hid information, that they had spies int he inspection teams, that they knew when the inspectors were coming. Inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  The truth in Syria is that North Korea was working with Syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the U.S. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. That agreement was worked out by one Jimmy Carter under the auspices of the Clinton administration. The North Koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning.

Six Feet Under is a great show, but after 5 seasons (not to mention the way the last one ended, what with the flashes into the future so we know what happens with the characters) a movie would be bizarre.  I'd LOVE to see a continuation of Carnivale though. That could definately work on the big screen. Still can't believe it was cancelled... Ugh.  A Deadwood or Soprano movie would be cool.

Enough said.seth rogen and morgan freemanJim Carrey He's never safe on the screen when he's in my sights.Your all just jealous. Jim Carey is great, Will Ferrell is funny, people just have different tastes in humor. And Fantastic Four was a good movie so Jessica Alba isn't a bad actor and she was good in Idle Hand as well. And whats wrong with Morgan Freeman?my opinion: i think will farrell is really funny...semi pro had me rollin and step brothers had me in stiches also....but im easily amused....  im tires of wesley snipes in straight to dvd films...

0 Silent Hill was a great moviewow...I was going to post that same exact clip...errrr...ok... I kid, Duncan...  I know my comment was directed to the OP.Pyramid Head was the only thing passable in that shit fest.god that movie is one of my top ten fav movies and my fav movie that i would consider being a horror flick.Ouch!that movie was terrible. just play the game.
0 This classic of restrained horror, directed by Albert Lewin and starring Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, and Donna Reed will be released on DVD for the very first time in October. Anyone else a fan of this film?I've never actually seen it but I'm a huge fan of Oscar Wilde. I might have to get hold of a copy next month.I read the book.how is it?the book?I believe there's a new movie in the works.Book was kinda boring.  Interesting.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235124/I love the 1945 film. Hurd Hatfield made a good Dorian Gray, but George Sanders stole the show as Lord Wotton. And the paintings (by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright) were excellent.
1 Support free speech and add to the conversationSimple: I didn't follow the campaigns at all and so have no idea what the candidates stand for or what their views are.  Also: Lazy. Ok thats a good reason not to vote. But it's not a smart thing to do. People have fought and died to allow you this right. you should be proud to do your own research and vote for the person you believe in.Aren't their issues on all the radio and tv stations? You don't have to do much researchIts' you again. DId you delete my last forum?Because my candidate dropped out. And I don't think that either mainstream candidate has the best interests of the country and it's citizens in their real plan. I also think the founding fathers would want another revoloution by now. Some people don't watch TV or listen to the radio. not because they are lazy but because the political system in this country is flawed. Dems try to make it about hope and future (even though they can't really bring about a better future) and the Republican try and win by using fear (a vote for Obama is a vote for a terrorist) as the videos you have posted proves (so thanks for proving my point for me Desperate Republicans). I don't have the power to delete forums. I can only show you how you are an idiot.  Last-minute research and listening to pundits does not quite equal the same as actually following the campaigns. And a lot of people have died for a lot of rights we don't invoke at every opportunity.  Also it really did sneak up on me.Hey  cut down on your meat intake. Blood pressure not good.

0 Go beach? screw school pride. This university is too much like high school. Who agrees?Drama, Drama and Drama is what happens @ CSULB. I've put up with it so long now! Time to move on.its better than sdsu. i like it.Too much of a commuter school...have only met a handful of people there in a year and a half!!! oh well, graduating next month so I guess it doesn't matter!!    But on a good note, they do have an excellent program for those interested in Psychology.The beach is sweet school to go to!i m going to CSULB next year....lolz...Third year and still lovin it!!!!!I think it's by far one of the best schools in the country. The only problem is you have to get yourself involved before it gets good. Have never had a problem making a friend here either.Do you guys really not like it there? CSULB is one of my top schools that I'm applying to. My majors fit there, and the location is perfect for me. But is it really not all it's cracked up to be?I've found that the people who complain about it being like high school are the same people that went to high school within 25-30 miles of it. That's the problem with a lot of commuter schools, (I grew up near Sacramento State).    I've also found that the people who love it tend to be the one's who get themselves involved. I moved onto campus at CSULB 2 1/2 years ago not knowing a single person -- and now I know plenty of people. I have more friends now than I did in high school and a more active social life for sure. And I was damn busy with my life in high school!        College is what you make it.      Although I will say that the lack of football or other tailgating sport may contribute to the lack of school spirit. But, really, often when I'm out and about wearing CSULB stuff (either in northern or southern california) people will come up and start talking to me about our sports anyway... I just smile and tell them that the sociology and human development are good.

I've been at Long Beach State for 4 years now and I have tons of school spirit, more friends than I could count, met hundreds of hot girls, partied like there was no tomorrow, and taken some of the most thought provoking classes that makes you really think about life.  College is about being on your own and having freedom, it's not about sticking to your old high school buddies because it's comfortable or cuz you're too much of a pussy to get out there and make something happen for yourself. Like the saying goes, "GO BEACH OR GO HOME!!!"
0 The beach is sweet school to go to!i m going to CSULB next year....lolz...Third year and still lovin it!!!!!I think it's by far one of the best schools in the country. The only problem is you have to get yourself involved before it gets good. Have never had a problem making a friend here either.Do you guys really not like it there? CSULB is one of my top schools that I'm applying to. My majors fit there, and the location is perfect for me. But is it really not all it's cracked up to be?I've found that the people who complain about it being like high school are the same people that went to high school within 25-30 miles of it. That's the problem with a lot of commuter schools, (I grew up near Sacramento State).    I've also found that the people who love it tend to be the one's who get themselves involved. I moved onto campus at CSULB 2 1/2 years ago not knowing a single person -- and now I know plenty of people. I have more friends now than I did in high school and a more active social life for sure. And I was damn busy with my life in high school!        College is what you make it.      Although I will say that the lack of football or other tailgating sport may contribute to the lack of school spirit. But, really, often when I'm out and about wearing CSULB stuff (either in northern or southern california) people will come up and start talking to me about our sports anyway... I just smile and tell them that the sociology and human development are good.csulb is/was thee best!I know a couple people that go there and they say its easy as shit, but its really hard to get out of there in 4 years because of how hard it is to get the classes you need for your major.For those who complain about not being able to meet people or it's like high school, then they should really put themselves out there to meet new people.

You're probably not having a good time and think it's too much like high school cuz you're only stickin too your little high school friends. You're in college now, get out there and meet people! In other words...grow up!

0 has anybody seen it?    the box office take says yes    and the reviews are mostly goodI LOVED IT.......sooo good....and people need to lay off on the guy......must see.....it was 2 1/2 hrs long but it didn't seem like itI just hope it's sufficiently better than Passion of the Christ.

I haven't seen it yet, but if the movie is ultraviolent, then it's historically accurate. The mayans were a blood thristy violent race of people. I've visited mayan ruins and learned about the history behind them. They were savages, pure and simple, and if the film wasn't ultraviolent it would be doing a disservice to the reality behind their culture.

JMO    Kevin,    Excuse me for noticing your completely ignorant comments about the Mayan people. If you truly did visit the Mayan ruins than you should know, much better then someone who's only experience with the MAya is the Apocalypto, that they were one of the most sophisitcated and advanced civilizations of the era.  My complaint about the movie, which was otherwise fairly accurate, was that it did not highlight the many scientific, economic, and cultural acheivements of the Great Maya civilization. Accurate calendars, acheivements in astronomy such as the knowledge of precession, somehting that wasnt proven as a theory til this century.    Savages? Excuse me but have you watched the news lately? Almost 3000 dead in Iraq, that's savage and this is the modern age. Back then it was about survival and at least it was real warfare hand to hand combat and such, not this pussyshit long range nuclear warheads, armored vehicles and shit. I'm talking about knives, arrows, spears, and straight up martial arts.    Too bad people like you are out there mischaracterizing our culture. I would be doing a great disservice to history to not highlight the way in which the Europeans, obviously your ancestors, savagely murdered, diseased, raped and pillaged this great civilzation in the pursuit of material wealth and religious purity.    Back to the movie, I'm not sure what Gibson's point with the Spaniards at the end. The "when it rains it pours" element sort of takes away from the much more consistent and relevant "don't let history repeat itself" message. Thoughts?

I would be doing a great disservice to history to not highlight the way in which the Europeans, obviously your ancestors, savagely murdered, diseased, raped and pillaged this great civilzation in the pursuit of material wealth and religious purity.    Back to the movie, I'm not sure what Gibson's point with the Spaniards at the end. The "when it rains it pours" element sort of takes away from the much more consistent and relevant "don't let history repeat itself" message. Thoughts?i was under the impression that the mayans were the peaceful ones and the aztecs were the bloodthirsty fighters anyways if it was the mayans in the movie than wouldnt the scene at the end be completely inaccurate because I thought the aztecs were visited and raped by the europeans not the mayans. mayans were long gone by then???i recall the timeline for central america was something like this: toltecs, mayans, and aztecs...maybe the news had it wrong or mel? anyway it was a good movie. oh and i know the whole timeline thing is off but i was just thinking of the last three major civilizations in central america so correct me if i'm wrong and no the Inca don't apply! "CENTRAL AMERICA, NOT SOUTH AMERICA!!!The film is great. Mel Gibson shows he passions thru he's films. BUT!!!! For those who done know the difference between Maya's and Aztec, Maya's are from south Mexico all the way down to Panama. Aztec's are from south Mexico and up to north Mexico.(more or less) Mel Gibson got the story or his info all wrong. They story is based in real events, but it was the Aztec who sacraficed 20, 000 indegenous people. The Maya's had mostly disapered by the time the Spanards landed in 1492. And it was Cortz who landed in Mexico, not Columbus.  I give Mel Gibson props for doing the film, just like Passion it will and had open conversions about those issues. Can't wait for a more factual film about the Maya's to be done. Ormaybe I'll sit down and write one for myself.  Well keep up with the topic cause its a good one.
1 dude this movie was awsome i thought. the only thing was i have no idea what the beheadings were all about. can anyone tell me? i didnt know that was going on. also was the virus and disease going around from when the europeans came to town? that wasnt columbus at the end was it? the lady havin the baby in the water was a little extreme but man it was an awsome movieIsn't that whole movie in a different language?Yes.      BUT HE MAD JEW HATING    Yes, I've seen it. I have a short review on my page (don't know if this is permitted to say, so delete /ignore/whatever! if so)    I highly recommend reading something about the movie before seeing it, if you plan to. Otherwise, most people will be befuddled, as the apparent plot isn't extremely clear - and lost in translation a bit too! I'm fascinated with the Inca, Aztec and Mayan cultures so was looking forward to seeing this. Don't know that this is a spectacular movie, but I think the depiction of the culture is pretty accurate. JMO    Kevin,    Excuse me for noticing your completely ignorant comments about the Mayan people. If you truly did visit the Mayan ruins than you should know, much better then someone who's only experience with the MAya is the Apocalypto, that they were one of the most sophisitcated and advanced civilizations of the era.  My complaint about the movie, which was otherwise fairly accurate, was that it did not highlight the many scientific, economic, and cultural acheivements of the Great Maya civilization. Accurate calendars, acheivements in astronomy such as the knowledge of precession, somehting that wasnt proven as a theory til this century.    Savages? Excuse me but have you watched the news lately? Almost 3000 dead in Iraq, that's savage and this is the modern age.

0 So what if we are sweaty when we get to the office! Tell your boss to install a shower in the rest room! We wouldn't get sick very often because we would be healthier and we would perform better at work because our minds would be sharper.  Something has got to be done about this gasoline business!  Any other suggestions on how to avoid paying for gas as much?Well Henry Ford powered his first model T with hemp seed oil. Maybe our fucked up gov't could change the law about growing hemp.  Didn't know much about hemp, so I looked it up. Seems like we should allow it here!  Hemp (from Old English hÃ¦nep, see cannabis (etymology)) is the common name for plants of the entire family of Cannabis, although the term is often used to refer only to Cannabis strains cultivated for industrial (non-drug) use. Hemp is cultivated virtually everywhere in the world except for the United States, and its cultivation in western countries is growing steadily. For example, Canadian Hempseed exports surged 300% last year[citation needed]. China, and other eastern countries, never prohibited its cultivation and use it extensively.  Industrial hemp has thousands of potential uses, from paper to textiles to biodegradable plastics to health food to fuel but it has not been the great commercial success that the enthusiast hoped for in countries where it is legal to harvest. It is one of the fastest growing biomasses on the planet, and one of the earliest domesticated plants known. It also runs parallel with the "Green Future" objectives that are becoming increasingly popular. Hemp requires little to no pesticides, replenishes soil with nutrients and nitrogen, controls erosion of the topsoil, and produces lots of oxygen, considering how fast it grows. Furthermore, Hemp could be used to replace many potentially harmful products, such as tree paper (the process of which uses bleaches and other toxic chemicals, apart from contributing to deforestation), cosmetics (which often contain synthetic oils that can clog pores and provide little nutritional content for the skin), plastics (which are petroleum based and cannot decompose), and more.    The first American Flag was sown of hemp, and the original draft of the Constitution was written on Hemp paper.Not me. It's 17 miles to work... one way. 17 miles back all up hill. I ave to get up at 4:30am. No way do I want a sore ass and more lack of sleep.Actually, I gotta big dog. I can just slap a couple of commercial liscense plates on him and ride him to work. Don't think I haven't been considering it either. And how the hell do you explain the fact that Diesel fuel is the most expensive out of them all??? It's the most unrefined fuel on the market. It's junk fuel and it used to be a little more expensive than dirt! Now it's like gold! WTF???Bringing back mass transit would be ideal. Filling up the average Semi costs $600.00, why not put that money back on the rails? It would take a long time to update the country, decades most likely, but the end result could/would be fantastic.I take the subway to work, it's great!Kind of hard to ride a bike to work in California most people have to drive 20 to 60 miles one way to work. If you live in downtown NY, Chicago, Seatle or San Fransisco its possible but not most of the country  That sounds right. In the orginal 13 colonies if you had a farm or plantation, it was illegal to not grow hemp. But this gov't we have today does everything just the opposite of the founding fathers who's principles & ideals made this country great. Look what these clowns are doing to it. I say we oust the bumbs Via that other great document called the Declaration of Independence.

Don't forget my second post:  "INDUSTRIAL hemp has thousands of potential uses, from paper to textiles to biodegradable plastics to health food to FUEL but it has not been the great commercial success that the enthusiast hoped for in countries where it is legal to harvest." "Hemp is cultivated virtually everywhere in the world EXCEPT for the United States, and its cultivation in western countries is growing steadily."hemp is VERY good skin lotionI ride a bike and use mass transit where possible. Saves gas, keeps me a bit more healthy, and I don't have nearly as much stress.

I still think we should grow it and yes you can make fuel with it but have you ever heard that old saying, "have you been smoking rope?".
0 If we are truly the greatest country in the entire fucking world, then why in fucking hell do we have republican controlled Supreme Court, which can influence who becomes president only if their is a tie in the presidential election as well as the fact that our free market is completely owned by big business. Gentleman and ladies if this country was so great we would not have a 9 trillion dollar debt, a failing dollar, a failing economy, and we would be a free nation except the patriot act, RFID act, and Rendition among other violations have hinder this free nation. If we are so free, then why do we have rendition to take suspected or compltely innocent Americans and locked them up and torture them in till the confessed to a crime they did not commit. This is the only beginning yet in mind is signals the end of the end as our nation is fixing to collaspe just like the Roman Empire.No country is completely "Free" that word shouldn't even exist.  Ok, finally someone with logic. To me socialism is better because you are born and you automatically know what the government and your place in your country. In capitalism when you are born your are fed lies or so be called truths which can remain true in till someone like Bush gets into office and changes those so called truths. Socialism only needs to be fair to the people to stay in controll. Capitalism needs a police force to monitor and to protect the free market so that no one gain absolute power over it. I think that is fair to say.  You are from Russia. I think I want to move there one day. Why live in a country that is changing from freedom to fascism. Why not live in a country where you know your place.   you for or against companies moving offshore? How about illegals working for a company? just curious  I believe a company has a right to make money; however, go over seas for cheap labor is wrong. If it cost more to make your products blame the gov. for inflation, then take action to lower costs by being innovated. To me thats sounds at least fair. Illegal immigrants not wanted. No help is wanted. If you want a job, then apply for a work vista. Do not cheat yourself or life.The following are the Justices on the Supreme Court and which president nominated them:  Chief Justice John Roberts - George W. Bush (considered to be more on the conservative end) Associate Justice John Paul Stevens - Gerald Ford (considered to be one of the more liberal members on the court) Associate Justice Antonin Scalia - Ronald Reagan (considered to be the most conservative on the court) Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy - Ronald Reagan (most moderate on the bench) Associate Justice David Souter - George H.W. Bush (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Clarence Thomas - George H.W. Bush (votes with the conservative wing) Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Bill Clinton (one of the more liberal voting justices) Associate Justice Stephen Breyer - Bill Clinton (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Samuel Alito - George W. Bush (considered to be more conservative)  Essentially, this is still a split court. You have 4 conservatives (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito) and 4 liberals (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer).  And then you have the swing vote in Kennedy.  Now please, explain to me how this Supreme Court is a "Republican controlled Supreme Court."Ok batman, you make a good point. So before I leave the country, what can we do to keep free market, fix the economy, fix the dollar, and over all fix mother liberty. what is the solution.  Back in 2000 it was a republican controlled supreme court, which of course changes from time to time. but still the point has been made. why does a suprem power possibly influened by one party or the other party make and decide who is to be in charge of our country. why not a re-vote or a boxing match. or something.  K. Now here is my stance on it all. I think if 1 is legal the other has to be. Simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market, less input for the same output. I'm not necessarily for both, but i do think that if Companies can go offshore, then companies who can't afford to (Despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  The problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. Right now, people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder, with socialism, you don't get the same kind of purpose, or drive, from the workers. What we have now, isn't a real capitalism because no matter what, the gov't still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  I would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.

Think about the 2000 election for a second. What did the Justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the Supreme Court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? What motive could Justice Scalia and then Chief Justice Rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? Do you know what would have happened to all the sitting "conservative" Justices if Gore had won instead? NOTHING. So how did the party have any influence over their decision?

So before I leave the country, what can we do to keep free market, fix the economy, fix the dollar, and over all fix mother liberty. what is the solution.  Back in 2000 it was a republican controlled supreme court, which of course changes from time to time. but still the point has been made. why does a suprem power possibly influened by one party or the other party make and decide who is to be in charge of our country. why not a re-vote or a boxing match. or something.  K. Now here is my stance on it all. I think if 1 is legal the other has to be. Simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market, less input for the same output. I'm not necessarily for both, but i do think that if Companies can go offshore, then companies who can't afford to (Despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  The problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. Right now, people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder, with socialism, you don't get the same kind of purpose, or drive, from the workers. What we have now, isn't a real capitalism because no matter what, the gov't still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  I would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.  hell if i knew then I would do something. i do not know. i do not know what to do in life. i just want to be free. not haveing to be enslaved or watch our mother liberyt by raped dried by those child-raping politicians who are destroying our beloved nation. what can we do?  How do you know my name? THat is not listed. I do not even have it anywhere on thiis computer or my email address. holy shit you are from the government.  The Supreme Court is completely independent, and was designed that way. The only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  So tell me, how exactly can any President, party, or politician have ANY influence over a member in the Supreme Court? What can they do? The Justice is nominated for LIFE. What could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting Supreme Court Justice, when that Justice has a guaranteed job no matter who's in power, and no matter what their decision is?  Think about the 2000 election for a second. What did the Justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the Supreme Court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? What motive could Justice Scalia and then Chief Justice Rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? Do you know what would have happened to all the sitting "conservative" Justices if Gore had won instead? NOTHING. So how did the party have any influence over their decision?To Seth: I looked up the 2000 supreme court judges and most of them were placed on the bench by republican presidents meaning that they swung towards bush. now the bench has some new people. but all in all one still must be weary of such a system. a system that can almost if given the power to do so or by themselves with the protection of the military decide who can live or die in this country by simple declarations. it is complicated. not one government or political system is perfect. i understand that.  My point is my country is not perfect but is going to rapidly change in the blink of an eye and freedom here will die. And I am not too sure how to live life anymore? I sent you a message to your myspace page on a private matter. that will help clear my mind in what I want to do in life. because i am not too sure on how to live life or what too do.Batman: Yeah Saint Michael is my pic. You scared me there for a moment. I do not mind living such a simple life. I have though about it. But i have feel that i meant to live for so much more. how can one achieve when all the odds and your own country is stacked against you. i am trying, my god I am trying yet I still have not reached the promised land. eventually i will find peace within my mind i do hope so.

0 Since Obamas win the other night, the press has basically called him the winner...now I am an Obama supporter..however I do know that the press, cable news (fox news lol)..has done whatever they could to antagonize his aspirations.  so with that being said  does anyone think that Obama is being setup, calling him the winner, making Hillary the underdog  with the upcomming primaries, the hillary turnout could possibly be tremendous enough to put the spotlight back on her and give her momentum again. Afterall, they are still shy a few superdelegates to clinch the nomination. Giving her enough momentum into the following primaries to plead her case.   Does anyone else besides me think that is in the realm of possibility?[Waits for Obamabots to flood in/] *waits for the obsessive obama haters to flood in and fight with the obamabots*  Well one side is in already.Do you suffer from a persecution/victim complex?  Nobody is "setting Obama up." He has been a media darling for well over a year; since the 2004 Democratic convention, as a matter of fact. It takes a mighty thick tinfoil hat to believe the media is suddenly going to pull the rug out from under him in an effort to give Hillary the nomination.  They might drop the guillotine once the General Election campaign starts, but I honestly doubt they're writing Hillary's obituary as some sort of reverse-psychology to resurrect her campaign with "underdog" votes.  Fact is, Hillary is set to win West Virginia by double-figures and has maintained a 20% + lead in opinion polls there for months, well before any of the post-North Carolina "Hillary is toast" chatter.  She is also heavily favored to win Kentucky and Puerto Rico by double digits, but if she doesn't keep Oregon close the media will continue to declare Hillary dead in the water.  Oh, hah, hilarity in its finest. [sarcasm/]  The only time I debate with an Obamabot is if they're totally insane and radicalist, Dunkle, or they're totally wrong, every Obamabot, usually.   Hey Bob, what the hell is the Bush/Cheney avatar all about. You DO know that Bush and Cheney are the biggest mass murderers of the 21st century right? Hmmm...I think you should be banned just for having that avatar...but that's just me, and pretty much the rest of the world.  And that is related to the topic of the thread how?  LOL..typical paranoid Obamaniacs.lol as a black man in america i embrace my paranoya...keeps me safe  A good question to Obama supporters and especially the black voters. Would you support Hillary Clinton if she was chosen to be the nominee by the superdelegates?

A theory that holds as much water as the theory that Obama is a Republican mole, chosen as the perfect enemy to defeat Hillary (a charming black male vs. a bulldog white woman) back in 2004.  In other words, unlikely.

Sorry, kid, but Democrats don't work that way--their delegation is meted out proportionally.ÃÂ  In Indiana, she "won" 51% to 49% so she comes out at best, a single delegate more than Obama got in Indiana.

In other words, unlikely.

0 It's pretty obvious they are going to try and play up her possible win West Virginia as the "unexpected game changer", now she just has to hope she has the momentum to do so.  You haven't been around politics long, son.Â  I'm a Ron Paul supporter and I say that's within the realm of possibility--all's fair in love, war, and politics, and that kind of thing's been done before.Â  Read history and learn something.  Well that is a good example of a black voter taking control of the situation rather than being controlled by the situation. I just ask this question just in case it might turn out that way. I just hope black voters will still turn out for Hillary even though it has been a rough primary. Hillary really did not have a choice but to be on the offensive against Obama and throw the kitchen sink at him due to the fact that Obama did take her by surprise with overwhelming victories after Super Tuesday. But it is definitely in Obama's favor right now to be the nominee. Good luck to all candidate. She herself was heard to say that she could claim big momentum just by a sweep in Puerto Rico.  She's changed her metrics from popular vote to superdelegate count to Big Mo.

1 Below are a few lines from Obama's books " his words:  From Dreams of My Father: "I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites."  From Dreams of My Father: "I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race."  From Dreams of My Father: "There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white."  From Dreams of My Father: ; "It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names."  From Dreams of My Father: "I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa, that I'd packed all the attri butes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, Dubois and Mandela."  From Audacity of Hope: "I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction."He was telling how he felt when he was growing up with trying to figure out was he too white, and not black enough in his early days.  For the last commet its more like he will stand by Saudi Arabia and our other Muslim ally countrys if Iran does something stupid. This could be why he wanted to talk to them at first but then released it wasnt going to do anything really. Doesnt hurt to try to talk retards.Do you honestly think President Bush and President Clinton and their appointed ones haven't tried talking to these governments? Maybe you should be reading more history books rather than biographies. LOL  clintion maybe but Bush talk to Iran please. They didnt talk to saddam when they invaded all they did was send to UN to make it like the US didnt want to go to war.The guy sounds like a schizophrenic paranoid psychopath.  Bush didn't talk to them. They're the Axis of Evil, remember? And we don't negotiate with terrorists, remember? And you can't possibly think that those quotes would win Obama votes. You can't really do much in this country without the white vote and it's not like, especially when taken out of context, those quotes really help him in any way.LOL - I'm well informed on what Bush has relayed to Iran's government and proud of him for it!

0   clintion maybe but Bush talk to Iran please. They didnt talk to saddam when they invaded all they did was send to UN to make it like the US didnt want to go to war.The guy sounds like a schizophrenic paranoid psychopath.  Bush didn't talk to them. They're the Axis of Evil, remember? And we don't negotiate with terrorists, remember? And you can't possibly think that those quotes would win Obama votes. You can't really do much in this country without the white vote and it's not like, especially when taken out of context, those quotes really help him in any way.LOL - I'm well informed on what Bush has relayed to Iran's government and proud of him for it!

Spanish police escorted petrol tankers into Barcelona as the stoppage, launched Monday, caused food and fuel shortages and huge tailbacks on the Spanish-French border. French railway workers began their own walkout, increasing the transport chaos. A Portuguese driver was killed after he was hit by a truck as he manned a barricade filtering traffic near Alcanena, north of Lisbon. A police spokesman quoted witnesses as saying the 52-year-old man climbed onto the side of a truck in a bid to stop it and fell off under the wheels, Lusa news agency reported. Later Tuesday, a truck driver in southern Spain was run over and killed by a van as he was working on a picket line outside a wholesale market in the southern city of Granada, police said. Other trucks in Portugal and Spain have been stoned or had their windows smashed and tyres punctured for working during the national strikes. Tens of thousands of truckers are on strike or joining the protests to demand government help to offset the higher fuel costs. While new talks with trucker representatives were held in Madrid, authorities in northern Spain ordered emergency measures after many petrol stations in the Catalonia region ran out of fuel. "Twenty tanker trucks escorted by the regional police left an industrial zone this morning for Barcelona port to help supply and distribute to petrol stations in the region," a regional police spokesman told AFP. Forty percent of petrol stations in Catalonia have run out of fuel, according to Manuel Amado, president of the Catalonia Federation of Service Stations. Arrivals of fresh meat, fish and fruit in Madrid have come to a near halt, according to officials at the Mercamadrid market, Spain's biggest wholesale market. They said that fish would be in short supply from Thursday but stocks of other foods should last until the end of the week. Automakers in Spain said most of the country's automobile plants, including those of Nissan, Mercedes Benz, Seat and Renault, have had to cut or halt production. Auto plants are particularly vulnerable to a strike by hauliers, which provide them with spare parts. Truckers stopped lorries from crossing the French-Spain border and caused major tailbacks around major Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. Spanish and French truckers staged pickets on either side of the frontier between the two countries. They blocked a bridge on the border at Bidassoa in the western Basque region and other main crossing points. On the French side, service areas on motorways were packed with trucks from the border right back to Bordeaux, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) away. Spain's second largest hauliers' union Fenadismer, which claims to represent 70,000 out of Spain's 380,000 truck drivers, launched an open-ended strike on Monday. Talks Monday between the hauliers and the government ended in failure, Fenadismer said. The Portuguese government said it hoped to have an agreement with its truckers by the end of the week. A separate strike by workers at the French rail company, SNCF, severely hit rail traffic. About half of intercity and local commuter trains were running along with about three quarters of TGV high speed trains from Paris to southwest France. Some express commuter lines into Paris were badly affected by the strike. Spanish fisherman were keeping up their strike against fuel prices but most French trawlers have decided to go back to work after several weeks of blocking ports and access to oil refineries.with the food shortage, the closing of the borders, the massive floods in the north of spain & basque country, the crisis in spain is escalating.Since fuel costs about twice as much in Europe as in the U.S., since oil has a world-wide price and the cost of refining is about the same everywhere, the difference is taxes.  Perhaps the Socialist governments should reduce some fo the taxes in an aeffort to not destroy their own countries.  And if you think prices are high now, just wait until Iran gets their nukes working (something that I notice the leftists think they should do.)ironic latin america & europe have better relations with the arabs then americans but the price of oil is higher, but its high all around now thanks to the us war in iraq & afghanistan.Give it a couple of years and people will stop going to work.  Because they cannot afford to.dont under-estimate public transporation (buses) & the motorcycle. the liscense & the gas for that is cheaper.i think this is a temporary problem, once the government negotiates with the union it will be taken care of, the lesson will be learned.I got me a little 125cc bike at the moment. I put £5 in it and it does 100 miles or so.  I use it instead of my car at the moment. The car does 100 miles on about £14.  I think the future is mopeds.better for the enviornment too.I would say that 99% of people don't give two shits about the environment. If petrol was cheap, I would have an American muscle car.  As it is, I use my Suzuki marauder to cruise about.  And that is so in America, you love your big old dumb cars.

So for your average joe it ain't going to be that hard to get around, but for the haulage industry it has been hard, as their petrol 'allowance' probably hasn't gone up.  This is has really got me excited, with rising fuel prices, world food shortage and the domestic economy, it seems like the shits hitting the fan hard. I am going to enjoy the next five years.

Make that paper while you can... Yes, actors work for the green, but usually the are somewhat good...This guy is justs horrible...Even his good looks can't compensate for his lack of talent...I want to know who he knows... I can't even believe you tried to defend him with a Walker/Alba collaboration...she is the famale equivalent of Paul Walker...  Except for that fact that Alba looks better in a bikini. :)   There is a fine line between actors and models.  For some the line is finer than for others.  I for one, watched the movie SIMPLY to see attractive actors on a beautiful beach location.  In the DVD featurettes, the actors stated as a simple fact that they were selected for their looks.  It was completely an unapologetic eye-candy fest.  And it delievered.  Every movie doesn't have to be Saving Private Ryan.  Some movies just need actors that are good-looking and charismatic...Good looking and charismatic? Matthew Mahogany's screwed then. but that's just it...they have zero charisma...I like eye candy silly movies just as much as the next person, but this guy...he's just the pits"just the pits"  Was that an intentional pun?

In the DVD featurettes, the actors stated as a simple fact that they were selected for their looks.  It was completely an unapologetic eye-candy fest.  And it delievered.  Every movie doesn't have to be Saving Private Ryan.  Some movies just need actors that are good-looking and charismatic...Good looking and charismatic? Matthew Mahogany's screwed then. but that's just it...they have zero charisma...I like eye candy silly movies just as much as the next person, but this guy...he's just the pits"just the pits"  Was that an intentional pun? no...I say that alot... McConnaughey has charisma....Paul does not...though neither has much acting range...I'm giving Matt the slight edge  Do we have the same definition of charisma? most likely no, if you had to ask...Why the hate for Matt...Okay, I think it's that damned drawl he's got...He says, "Darlin" and my toes curl...  Because he's a lump of wood. Also his hair is really shit and he always looks so smug. He is not a lump of wood...Walker is a lump of wood!...I think McConnaughey appeals to men and women...he's a likeabe character...what films have you not like dhim in? His hair is fake...he was balding a few years back, now it has seemed to magically re-appeared...  What movies has he been in? That's pretty much your answer. Paul Walker is an insignificant piece of bark.

Let's see: Matt has been in: How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days...cute rom-com A Time to Kill...pretty good Grisham adaptation, maybe the best one...solid movie is just to see Sam Jackson's performance Frailty...pretty good movie We Are Marshall...very under-rated well, that's about all I've liked him in, which is much more than a Paul Walker list

Only thing, Im surprised is that he admitted it. But he isnt the 1st to do it, I wouldnt be surprised if Cuba did that.  also, this kind of makes wesley snipes and van damme look real good right now. I think Van damme turned down doin rush hour 3.

0 hi! can somebody pls give me any science fair idea for high school? Ppplllleeeeaaaassssseee!!!! I badly need it right now! thanks!Here is oneâ¦prove that Past present and further donât really exists, that the perception of âtimeâ is simply just conciseness, ability to process information and memory.This is a rather fun one that I always wanted to do. Even though most winners at science fairs are biology projects this one is still way cool and is a physics one.    You measure the speed of light. Here is what you need a microwave (without the automatic turn table), some chocolate or cheese, an accurate ruler (measurements in milimeters), a plate.    What you do is break up the cheese or chacolate and spread it up along the plate. Put it in the microwave and turn it on... observe it and wait for small parts of it to melt. This phenomina happens because the microwaves which are inside your microwave oven form a standing wave. This is why you have to stir food in it to cook it or have a turn table, or have you ever noticed how one bit will be real hot, and then the bite right next to it will be ice cold? The goal is to let it form a few hot spots that melt the cheese in those places. Then you want to take a ruler and measure the distance between each of the hotspots. You now know the wavelength of microwaves, it will be best to convert this length into meters (it will be like .005 meters or something like that though) . Now to figure out the speed of light    c = speed of light (electromagnetic radiation)  l = wavelength of the light  f = frequency of the light    The equation is as follows    c = l*f    You measured l, now to get f, look on the back of the microwave and look for the frequency of the waves. It will probably be in MHz or something like that (I don't remember the frequencies of microwaves off the top of my head). Mulitply l times f and you have just figured out the speed of light!hey, that's supposed to be a riddle! don't give it away      anyhow, you want some fun stuff, there's all kinds of stuff. you could make a tesla coil or vand de graff machine. Those are funDuckweed. Use duckweed. It produces a shitload of protein . I did something about the effects of different fertilizers (including guppy poop...ever try to figure out the nitrogen composition of guppy shit?). It would be interesting to see how different growing conditions influence protein production, or find the optimum condition for protein production in a natural setting and try to increase it. pH, temperature, light access, etc.
1 Friday, April 11, 2008   Associated Press WASHINGTONÂ âÂ  The Bush administration is likely to move its research on one of the most contagious animal diseases from an isolated island laboratory to the U.S. mainland near herds of livestock, raising concerns about a catastrophic outbreak. Skeptical Democrats in Congress are demanding to see internal documents they believe highlight the risks and consequences of thedecision. An epidemic of the disease, foot and mouth, which only affectsanimals, could devastate the livestock industry.  One such government report, produced last year and already turned over to lawmakers by the Homeland Security Department, combined commercial satellite images and federal farm data to show the proximity to livestock herds of locations that have been considered for the new lab. "Would an accidental laboratory release at these locations have the potential to affect nearby livestock?" asked the nine-page documentÂ· It did not directly answer the question.

But being polarized with such bias how can you be expected to see clearly?I was speaking to the guy from New MexicoStart here:  http://theoneworldgovernment.com/content/view/25/38/  http://www.corporations.org/media/  http://www.sweetliberty.org/issues/shadow/jewishmedia.htmExcuse me. Texas. My eyes caught the "Mexico" in your locale and I typed in New Mexico.  This one was my favorite. I never knew that people like Gilbert Gottfried and Geddy Lee were secretly controlling television broadcasts. I knew there HAD to be a reason we had over a decade of Jerry Seinfeld on TV. Now it's all clear. What a lovely man.  I wonder what he does for a living.

0 It seems like a lot of movies coming out aren't quality. i might not listen to garbage but come on now she's hawtBecause they banned pens from insane people =]. And what's wrong with Garbage? They're a brilliant band - Infact my favourite lol!  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWhstBecuase Holly wood no longer knows how to write great movies that's why we get all these crappy insiderable remakes  Or has no one come to noticed this year's most anticipated movies and next years are all super hero based  2008  The Dark Knight Iron Man The Incredible Hulk Hell Boy 2  2009  Spiderman 3 Transformer 2 G.I Joe Friday the 13th (Remake) Child's Play (Remake) Tekken Dragon Ball  the list goes onFriday the 13th (Remake) Child's Play (Remake) Tekken Dragon Ball  Those are probably gonna be hot garbage.  lolz no that would be my first post  No they will be a load of Hyped Bullocks Garbage  Child's Play could work but what else can they do with it make it more scarier nada, just probably add more gore and CGI  Dragon Ball, do i hear a fan riot for making a white guy, Goku  Friday the 13th being produced by Michael Bay, juss gonna have more gore and under developed character background on Jason Voorhees as for Bay has poor developmental writing skills. Which will also be his flaw when he comes to produced and co-write 'A Nightmare On Elm St (2010).  Tekken automatically failsbecause trash makes moneyBecause the younger generation have shitty taste in movies.

Remakes equal easy money. Then again, the originals stand to earn money too. Remake comes out, then it makes people want to see the original. According to my list, 2009 stands to be a much bigger year than 2008. Incredible Hulk can suck a fat one. Even though it looks better than the last one, still looks like shit.

Garbage does rock though...You mean, 2 bucks too many No, it's just because we the movie goers don't care to see originals therefore they don't get released everywhere, nor during the summer..  Box office shows that we prefer popcorn movies over movies that are really good like say, No Country for Old men, There will be blood, those movie didn't do a fraction of what that mess called Spider-man 3 did..  And like i said, we will just see how many of you that keep screaming for something original in hollywood, that will head out to watch The Strangers May 30th.. in fact how many of you have even bothered to rent The Orphanage?

Even though it looks better than the last one, still looks like shit.They make crappy movies because you pay to see them.

Box office shows that we prefer popcorn movies over movies that are really good like say, No Country for Old men, There will be blood, those movie didn't do a fraction of what that mess called Spider-man 3 did..  And like i said, we will just see how many of you that keep screaming for something original in hollywood, that will head out to watch The Strangers May 30th.. in fact how many of you have even bothered to rent The Orphanage?

0   No they will be a load of Hyped Bullocks Garbage  Child's Play could work but what else can they do with it make it more scarier nada, just probably add more gore and CGI  Dragon Ball, do i hear a fan riot for making a white guy, Goku  Friday the 13th being produced by Michael Bay, juss gonna have more gore and under developed character background on Jason Voorhees as for Bay has poor developmental writing skills. Which will also be his flaw when he comes to produced and co-write 'A Nightmare On Elm St (2010).  Tekken automatically failsbecause trash makes moneyBecause the younger generation have shitty taste in movies.  That's exactly it.  I'm actually kind of curious on Dave's comment.

Saw it at the theater... But it's not a Hollywood picture.  Which backs up my point, there were a LOT of good films released in 2007, it's up to you to track them down.Hollywood is seeing the Bollywood effect at the moment. The architect about how a movie comes to be made has changed drastically in Hollywood over the last decade. Churn out lots of movies and they only have to be ok in quality. Turn a modest profit at the box office because the B.O. is now a secondary revenue stream to the direct sell-through DVD, PPV, Foreign Distribution and cable TV markets.  Hollywood used to be a talent based industry -- Audiences would go see movies for the talent (actors; directors) even more than they do now. However, now it is a packaged goods industry on the studio side where talent takes a back seat to the movie itself (the high concept), and why marketing the movie is more important than anything else. A movie's main theatrical run is now just a 110 minute commercial for the eventual DVD release where it can make 10x its B.O. take.  Teens still go to the movies each weekend which throws a whole other dimension into the mix and is why most of the products offered cater to this demographic.  So... How does this explain movies just being not as good as the ones in previous years from a strictly business perspective?  The emphasis isn't on quality anymore. It's on quantity.  There will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. That's just a four month period (May-August). Consider how many movies come out PER YEAR (in the U.S.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. Also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  Studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike B.O. gold -- Like "Juno" -- They can maximize the profits.  Most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the B.O. because they will easily make that back through DVD rentals. These days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. These are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like "Transformers" etc. -- Properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  It is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be "good" anymore. They just have to be on the market and interest you in the DVD. Because once you buy or rent the DVD, even if the movie "sucks" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  But to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. This decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world.

Hollywood used to be a talent based industry -- Audiences would go see movies for the talent (actors; directors) even more than they do now. However, now it is a packaged goods industry on the studio side where talent takes a back seat to the movie itself (the high concept), and why marketing the movie is more important than anything else. A movie's main theatrical run is now just a 110 minute commercial for the eventual DVD release where it can make 10x its B.O. take.  Teens still go to the movies each weekend which throws a whole other dimension into the mix and is why most of the products offered cater to this demographic.  So... How does this explain movies just being not as good as the ones in previous years from a strictly business perspective?  The emphasis isn't on quality anymore. It's on quantity.  There will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. That's just a four month period (May-August). Consider how many movies come out PER YEAR (in the U.S.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. Also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  Studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike B.O. gold -- Like "Juno" -- They can maximize the profits.  Most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the B.O. because they will easily make that back through DVD rentals. These days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. These are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like "Transformers" etc. -- Properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  It is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be "good" anymore. They just have to be on the market and interest you in the DVD. Because once you buy or rent the DVD, even if the movie "sucks" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  But to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. This decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world.^Thats an article I found somewhere a few weeks back and saved it to my hard-drive. It saved me typing what I already knew though:)In total...From a studio standpoint it's much easier to go with a sure thing and proven commodities/formulas than to risk allot of money an a "personal original film" from an artist(which can take years to create and make).  My bad lol ahhh yeah i cant believe i fucking forgot Avatar  Even tough it aint anticipated i'm looking forward to seeing the comeback of Cameron in FULL IMAX 3D  True but its still early for Avatar but i do reckon by Christmas this year Cameron will definately send us a present to hold us until Dec 2009.  I mean the Viral marketing for The Dark Knight didn't begin until a year before it was due release to hit Cinema, when we saw that beautiful teaser revealing Ledger voice and laugh.  its sitting next to me but i havent had time to watch it yet =(Because too much thought is put on special effects and not enough on the scripts.
0  No, it's just because we the movie goers don't care to see originals therefore they don't get released everywhere, nor during the summer..  Box office shows that we prefer popcorn movies over movies that are really good like say, No Country for Old men, There will be blood, those movie didn't do a fraction of what that mess called Spider-man 3 did..  And like i said, we will just see how many of you that keep screaming for something original in hollywood, that will head out to watch The Strangers May 30th.. in fact how many of you have even bothered to rent The Orphanage?  Saw it at the theater... But it's not a Hollywood picture.  Which backs up my point, there were a LOT of good films released in 2007, it's up to you to track them down.Hollywood is seeing the Bollywood effect at the moment.

True also the simple fact as well is that it stood for everything that Narnia was against lol. I mean Narnia was so christian style while Compass was atheist style in which even the God like character dies in the end.  In my opinion LOTR & Spiderwick were the best on that list, Compass was alright but that polar bear flew one mean right hook

I love how well you liberals use such, fancy big words to makeÂ your point!It's not a very good one but here's a picture of Josh Brolin as George Bush   close enough...I guess...Josh looks meaner that W I don't see how that's possible, considering that Bush caused 9/11. Josh would never do that. stop that...I absolutely do not think that. It was the use of the word liberal as an insult. But I've already adressed that in another thread.

He's just living the american dream! You know, financing two wars with credit cards from china! For as much as has been spent in the wars, is how much the US will have to pay back to china, plus interest. This isn't pinko liberal faggity talk. This is money talk. Some dumbass who got the pulitzer prize in economics wrote a book saying this war is going to cost at least 3 trillion dollars (trillion is a word liberals like to use, 3 syllables). anyway, china will own the US, and bush still doesn't own Iraq, and the US soldiers who don't own their arms or legs or brains will be cared for, until they die, and that bill hasn't even started to come in yet. Wow, sounds like this could be a very interesting movie! Can't wait! I wonder if it will be as sick as the real thing.

1 Tue Jun 3, 5:00 PM ET    OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. soldiers who have deserted the military because of the war in Iraq should be allowed to stay permanently in Canada, the House of Commons voted in a nonbinding motion on Tuesday.  ADVERTISEMENT  The three opposition parties, which together hold a majority of seats in the House, backed a motion that said the government should allow conscientious objectors and their families "who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations" to stay in Canada.  Canada was a haven for tens of thousands of draft dodgers during the Vietnam War and has attracted an estimated 175 to 200 Americans who are resisting the Iraq conflict.  "I think Canada has always been a place which has welcomed those who seek peace and seek freedom," Bob Rae, foreign affairs spokesman for the main opposition Liberal Party, told reporters outside the Commons after the vote.  The minority Conservative government opposes the idea, arguing that, unlike during the Vietnam War, the current U.S. military is composed of volunteers, and also that Washington allows people to apply for conscientious objector status.  "People do not join with their eyes closed. If they do, then they have their own problems," Conservative Member of Parliament Laurie Hawn, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Canadian Air Force, said during debate on the motion.  The Supreme Court of Canada refused last November to hear appeals of two U.S. deserters whose applications for refugee status had been turned down by immigration authorities.

Hey, if they come back to the States, then throw the book at them. When they're not, it's just not worth fighting with friendly nations about.

ÃÂ  No, even our libtard government wanted them to leave. It was their equally libtarded voters who demanded the cowards be allowed to remain on my soil.  ÃÂ  I neither want your deserters, nor your Mexicans. The moment Mexicans start to trickle through our border, I suggest it is time to retrieve our troops from Afghanistan, and have them shoot any of the fuckers attempting to make the mess of our country that they have of yours. Not going to happen on my watch. I am already working towards getting Muslims booted out of Canada since a few of their own were spying on one of our nuclear power plants with the sole intention of bombing it.

That i may have to go into combat and be killed.  My son currently is srving. He enlisted with the same foreknowledge.  There is no draft. enlistment is NOT mandatory. If you dont want to uphold the oath you must take to enlist, DONT ENLIST. No one forced them to enter the service.  To most people who are clueless about war, there is NO children. There is NO Women.  When compassion enters into it, you DIE. you team members DIE.  You are no less dead from being shot by a 10 year old then you are from anyone else. WE learned that lesson well in vietnam. 5 year olds walk into a group of GI's and detonate a grenade becuase the "enemy" taught them to.  I woudl have to disagree with some of the IRAQ "vets" howver who claim you are tuaght to kill everything if you recieve fire. This is catergorically incorrect. just as law enforcement are taught to identify threats so are soldiers taught to do the same. You aim a weapon at me, I kill you . you are a woman walking by someone with a weapon shooting at me I DONT shoot her. some people are idiots.
0 Breaking News >> Supreme Court Says Individuals Have Right to Own Guns, Strikes Down D.C. Handgun Banhttp://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=343&sid=1429208  Supreme Court says Americans have right to guns By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court says Americans have a right to own guns for self-defense and hunting, the justices' first major pronouncement on gun rights in U.S. history.  The court's 5-4 ruling strikes down the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns as incompatible with gun rights under the Second Amendment. The decision goes further than even the Bush administration wanted, but probably leaves most firearms laws intact.  The court had not conclusively interpreted the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791. The amendment reads: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."  The basic issue for the justices was whether the amendment protects an individual's right to own guns no matter what, or whether that right is somehow tied to service in a state militia.   (Copyright 2008 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)  So does the Constitution. Thank god the SC can see that.  at heart, americans kinda like to kill each other so there are two things you'll never see, a ban on guns or a ban ..ion. so get over it and move on to things you can actually do something about, raising the standard of living for all americans, better education, including sex education, better jobs, etc.  those things will have more impact on the death toll than banning guns or abortion. X2too bad they screwed up yesterday over the no death for child rapists thoughGood. They have almost redeemed themselves. Ummmm...same thing really.Fantastic! It is about time somebody could read English.A 5-4 decision again? The other 4 should be tested for crack cocaine. A triumph for the 2nd amendment, but mark my words, one day they will come for your guns.

0 they die in jail. even convicts have higher principles than SCOTUS. though to be fair, SCOTUS 1.) probably knows this and 2.) is bound by the Constitution, which doesn't specifically address this.Here's a fun fact:  In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  -http://flightpundit.com/archives/2008/03/23/gun-facts/ a pattern that has been repeated throughout history...  Since Australia has banned ordinary handguns and citizens were forced to give up their guns, crime has increased.  The same will happen if the 2nd Amendment gets dropped.McCain: Obama's gun position 'elitist'Anti-gun people should not be allowed to have armed bodygurards.  Anti-gun people should not be allowed to have armed police protection.  That's becuase only the honest law abiding citizens will obey the law. Criminals aren't going to say "Ok, we'll not break that gun law ... but the others are fair game".Â  That's just rediculous.Â  Criminals are going to keep their guns, and get more on the black market.Â  The only thing gun-control gaurantees is that the innocent people can't deffend themselves against criminals with guns.Â  THAT is why DC's gun crime has sky-rocketted in the last 30 years under their gun-crontrol laws.  Be preaired for DC's crime rate to drop like a brick now that your averatge joe can deffend himself.  Give it 6 months to decline...  Unless the DC lawmakers do some fast rewriting and figure out how to reinstate the effect of the law...If they could manage to pull together accurate statistics, I wouldn't be surprised if it dropps off sharply after just one or two months. If I was a resident of DC, I'd go get my new gun TODAY.

0 I'm tired of hearing people saying I should vote, but refusing to give me a good answer as to why its so important. I can give them a thousand reasons why I don't vote, but theyÂ generaly cant give me a single one that isn't pure rhetoric.Â I just wanna hear some good answers. I wont poke fun or be mean I promise, I just wanna hear some good arguments for it, and who knows, maybe someone can get me to vote (but I doubt it).  You don't have to vote.it seems that you made up your mind not to vote...so why bother?Write in someone or pick a third party candidate if you hate the 2 parties candidate.does anyone think that the election process should be changed from electoral to popular vote?  That was my suggesion too. If everyone would grow some nuts and vote for who they like best, as opposed to the lesser of 2 evils, things might change. People are afraid to "waste their vote", which keeps the Democrats/Republicans in power. IMO, a vote for either major party at this point is a wasted vote, at least in the Presidential race. Of course, there isn't much for 3rd chouces either, but at least it sends a message.  yepLocal and State elections, (and propositions?) Yes...please vote.  On a national level? What difference does it make?you should vote because it is a right given to you...you either exercise it or you lose it. not voting doesn't change a thing or make any sort of statement or give you more of a right to criticize, no matter what george carlin said, god rest his soul. and voting for a third party or a rebel or a renegade isn't a wasted vote either as most party pollywannacrackers would like you to believe. it's just their way of ensuring that two and only two (arguably one) parties stay in power and to squash that the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and even seven parties that a nation this age and of such diversity should have by now. definately.

I feel it is the biggest scam going on.McCain is relying on lazy votersTo your question I will just say that the one year that I did not vote Bush won, and in him winning oil prices soared, healthcare, insurance, food prices soared as well. Secondly, It is best that I try to get people in office who will best represent me and the choices I make in life in addition to the lifestyle I choose to keep. I also have a huge fear that if we choose to not be the deciding factors in the candidacy for presidency, then someone else will. Would you feel safe giving that responsibility to any one group in America? Please make your vote count. Consider the most important things in life to you and vote for the person who will most likely help you keep those things close to home. K #1. It's called freedom of speech. #2.ÃÂ  If I vote for a candidate and he turns into a huge douchebag do I still have grounds to complain? (e.g. Bush) #3.ÃÂ  If you think every candidate sucks ass and none of them are worthy of your vote you get more respect from me than if you vote for the person that sucks the least [out of the top 2 parties because you think a 3rd party vote is a wasted vote]. #4.ÃÂ  They're taking your money, they're running your lives.ÃÂ  You ALWAYS have the right to complain. why?...plain and simple....IT GIVES YOU BITCHING RIGHTS!!!!!! If you don't participate shut up....you don't vote you don't count and actually dont deserve any sayso on the matters.....I've seen people in wheelchairs truck a mile to vote...and you don't....that is sad.  WINNAR.  To address another point, if voting is a right, why do I have to register to do so?  In that regard, driving or getting married is a right.ÃÂ  I should just be able to walk in and do it when I feel like it.  I'm not up for lesser of two evils garbage, either.ÃÂ  16 years of crap for candidates ought to have taught everyone that a vote for a shitty candidate is...validation of a shitty candidate.  That is how the campaigns looks at it.  The End. if anyone just can walk up and just vote...how are you gonna know if these people actually are citizens of this country?...dont you think it'd be a little chaotic?....btw..driving is not a "right"...its a privilege...you earn it.  The problem with using popular voting as a definitive method of making decisions about representatives. . .is that the popular vote is VERY easy to f*ck with. Given the motivation, it's really simple for someone to submit dozens of ballots using a falsified identity with each one.

Of course, that might not happen every time. . .but why take the risk?  I'm not saying that I agree with the Electoral College, either, since it has its own flaws. A new system should be created that does a better job at giving people a say in their government, and in the selection of representatives.It really makes no difference if you do or don't.we have had Presidential elections decided by a hundred thousand votes..two tenths of a percentage point....and 70 million people voted...literally a small town.

Here's the one and only reason I can think of to vote. How would you like it if you had NO SAY WHATSOEVER in who you think should be President? What if someone said "This is what you get like it or not, your opinion doesn't count". I know come election day the person I vote for won't win BUT I can go to the voting booth and say... "This is who I think should be President." A lot of people in this world don't even get that.
0      Ugh, horrible to watch.If that had been beer we wouldn't have ever seen this video.It made my day watching him get it   By the way, all US Military that go through flight training and S.E.R.E.

Japanese were later convicted of war crimes due to their use of the practice on American POWs.  -During the Vietnam war, US Generals declared the practice illegal and several court martials occurred due to the revelation that the practice was being carried out by US and South Vietnamese troops.   The Imperial Japanese, the Fascist Nazis, the Pinochet regime, the Khmer Rouge, etc have all used waterboarding. And now the US does. Nice company we keep, don't you think? they go through it to be able to withstand it and recognize it so that if they are captured they won't succumb to the TORTURE that it IS. Another reason they go through it is to weed out weaklings. Steal-your assertion that "anyone who swims or surfs alot can easily beat this" is completely ridiculous. Do you really think this is where the interrogation stops if no information is obtained? They go straight from waterboarding to beatings and electric shocks. The difference with this video, and the training of our military personnel, is that the training eventually stops. The torture to extract information does not.  I'd really like to see any of the dumbasses in here who support this go through it just once. They'd admit to having sex with their own mother or father to make it stop. ESPECIALLY if they didn't know what was coming next. Could be freedom, could be jumper cables attached to their testicles. They'd say anything to get the first, and they'd say anything to prevent the second. That's why torture has been proven time and time again to not get the real information you need. Gaining a prisoner's trust and extracting information through more subversive measures is far more likely to get the desired results.What a pussy... you want torture... live with my wife for a week...

0 Now mexico wants to control our laws? Either mexico should keep their people on their side or their leaders should be assassinated! Damn, I hate that country!   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico - Mexico is protesting the execution of one of its citizens in Texas despite a world court ruling for a new hearing, expressing concern for the rights of other Mexicans detained in the United States.  Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said it sent a note of protest to the State Department about Jose Medellin's case, which drew international attention because of allegations that Medellin wasn't allowed to consult the Mexican consulate for legal help following his arrest.  Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston.  Medellin was convicted of participating in the gang rape, beating and strangling of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14. Prosecutors said he and five fellow gang members attacked the girls as they were walking home on a June night, raped and tortured them for an hour, then kicked and stomped them before using a belt and shoelaces to strangle them.  "I'm sorry my actions caused you pain. I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbor hate," Medellin said to those gathered to watch him die. "Never harbor hate."  In Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, where Medellin was born, a small group of his relatives condemned the execution.  "This is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only God," said Medellin's cousin Reyna Armendariz.  A large black bow and a banner that read "No to the death penalty ... may God forgive you," hung from an iron fence in the front of the house where Medellin lived before moving to the United States at the age of 3.  Armendariz said the family hopes Medellin's body would be return to Mexico.  "He signed a paper saying he wanted his remains to go to a friend. Who knows if they will bring him here," Armendariz said sobbing.  The Mexican government statement said officials "were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country."  An international court ruled in 2004 that the convictions of Medellin and 50 other Mexicans on death row around the United States violated the Vienna Convention, which calls for people arrested abroad to have access to their home country's consular officials.  Texas state officials say Medellin didn't ask to do so until well after he was convicted of capital murder.  The International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, said the Mexican prisoners should have new court hearings to determine whether the violation affected their cases.  President Bush asked states to review the cases, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this year neither the president nor the international court can force Texas to wait.  I think the precedent is obvious. Don't do capital crime. It's not that hard to understand.I read that story this morning.... I might, just might, understand if the accused had been here a short time, but this fella came to America when he was 3, has been here 30 years. I'm quite sure, he does not need a Mexican consulate explaining to him our laws.Yeah, well he is getting some laws explained to him now, ones he should have known all along.That piece of filth got what he deserved! All these far-lefft loons have gone crazy, they care more about the killer than about the victim. They will never remember the two girls he raped and killed.I don't know what disgusts me more...  The fact that the bastard raped those two girls, the fact that he hypocritcally preached against hatred (he deserved it for what he did to those poor girls), or the fact that the Mexican government is basically endorsing his crimes.  Hear me illegal aliens, look, if you're so determined why don't you overthrow the assholes in charge of Mexico and make it a better place to live? Or do you condone these heinous actions yourself?  Seriously anyone who defends these bastards should themselves be put in jail. He is just lucky I wasn't there. He meaning both the rapist and the government official."nobody has the right to take another..."  He took TWO lives! TWO! And here he is saying that his cousin is worth more than the two girls he strangled and violated?  Sorry the statement of the cousin just pissed me off enough to warrant its own rant."Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston."  "The Mexican government statement said officials 'were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.' "  A couple of points: 1) why did it take 15 years to off this pond scum?Â  2) If Mexico is soooooooooooooo concerned about the treatment of their citizens in the USA, why don't they stop encouraging them to come here?  I'd also like to point out that government execution is not a matter of one man deciding to take the life of another man. It is by the LAW that this waste of space was executed.Â  The LAW DOES have the right.Everyone seems to be missing the point here. By deliberately renouncing the Vienna Convention, U.S. citizens abroad no longer have a right to request consular assistance. The world is fully cognoscente that the word of the United States on an international treaty is now worthless.

0 Call it bullshit if you want. If said American citizen was arrested for spitting on a Singapore sidewalk before today, the government of Singapore would be required to advise the American consulate in Singapore of the arrest and grant consular access to the arrested party.

Thank God the great state of Texas still upholds the law and protects its citizens. If more states would wake the fuck up and put more of these assholes to sleep this kind of shit would slow down to a near halt. Too bad they won't air these executions on pay per view. Then we could give the proceeds to the victims families and some of these fucking animals would see for themselves what rape and murder will get you. DEAD!  My sympathy goes out to the families of these girls. I can't imagine what this did to them.

1 VIVA la RESISISTANCE(but4real this time dude) Body: Is It Time for a Rebellion? October 20, 2008 "50 percent NO and 50 percent HELL NO!"--Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va. ) on feedback received from his constituents regarding Congress' bailout package Mere days after President Bush signed into law an $810 billion bailout bill aimed at rescuing the Wall Street financiers, one of the recipients, American International Group Inc., threw a $440,000 bash for its executives at a swanky resort, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. At the same time that AIG execs were celebrating lavishly, indirectly at taxpayer expense, nearly 12 million American taxpayers, who owed more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, were in danger of foreclosure. As if it weren't bad enough that a fiscally irresponsible corporate America is going to be bailed out at taxpayer expense, Congress included more than $100 billion in pork barrel projects in the bill. Nothing short of congressional bribes, these so-called inducements range from an exemption from excise tax for wooden arrows designed for use by children and tax write-offs for motorsports racing track facility owners to tax rebates on rum imported from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as imported wool. This is not relief, it is economic slavery. It has become increasingly clear that the greatest threat to our freedoms--and our bank accounts--does not lurk outside our borders. Rather, it prowls among us, in the form of a government of wolves that is running wild and riding roughshod over our freedoms. There was a time when such a blatant disregard for the burden being laid upon the American taxpayer would have elicited howls of outrage, protest marches and perhaps even outright rebellion. Today, however, many Americans understandably feel helpless to do anything about their plight. After all, despite the fact that calls and emails to congressional offices were overwhelmingly against the $810 billion pork-laden bailout, the legislation passed anyway. Yet consider this: at its core, the quest for the American dream is about gaining sovereignty over one's life and property. Without it, there can be no freedom. While we have become accustomed to equating property with land ownership, the term is much more fundamental and personal. It refers to a kind of sovereignty over one's life and possessions--especially one's money. Questions about who has ultimate control over our money, how much of it can be claimed by government and how it gets spent go to the heart of the battle over property rights. Governments generate no wealth on their own. Any resources that they have at their disposal have been appropriated from the original producers of that wealth, the citizens. This fundamental truth has largely been forgotten over the years. Yet the government's respect for and treatment of the property of its citizens often reflects its attitude regarding its citizens' rights as a whole. Conversely, a government that doesn't respect the rights of its citizens will have even less regard for their property--be it land, money or personhood. With the Wall Street bailout, the President and Congress simply disregarded the clear will of the people. And while secret agreements were obviously made and backroom bargains struck, the Constitution and our rights were not even given a second thought. However, those who wrote the Constitution drafted our founding document with the intention of ensuring that the power of government remained with the people. The Framers wanted citizens to know what the government is doing and how it spends taxpayer funds. And if the elected officials aren't doing their jobs or the people disagreed with their performance, the Framers empowered the people to unseat their representatives. Without these safeguards, there is no representative government. Since the country's inception, America has been synonymous with the concept that there are certain individual rights and freedoms that no one, not even government agents, can violate. As the Declaration of Independence boldly proclaims: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. " These were revolutionary ideas in an age of kings and serfdoms, and they served as a springboard for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These rights were considered absolute and so precious that no government can violate them. And the early American colonists believed these principles were not only worth fighting for, they were worth dying for. One of these was the right of the people to change or do away with a government that attempts to undermine their rights. As the Declaration concludes, "whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. " Governments are brought into being to protect our rights. When they systematically violate them, the people have a right--nay, a duty--to resist. This was the true spirit of 1776 that moved the American colonists to start a revolution against a government that was violating their rights. This willingness to stand and fight against corrupt government was what it meant to be an American in our nation's early years. And if we truly want to be Americans today, it will mean practicing every form of nonviolent resistance available to us as citizens--including picketing, mass protests, sit-ins, boycotts and so on. It will certainly take more than voting for or against a particular politician. Thomas Jefferson was right: "What country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance?" Available online at: http://www. rutherford. org/articles_db/commentary. asp?record_id=559 Exactly dude thats what i been tripping on for to long!! we have to take action its getting worse all the time!!! any ideas for putting together a meeting of some sort? maybe finding hella people who see it like that too so we can all change this country back to what we were supposed to stand up for, so we represent and stand for what we were meant to stand up for. how often are elections started with an idea that we, the actual people, has decided? we are brain washed into believing we are making the important decisions when in all actualites THEY,[the "president"(our king) and his noble mary men(the government end elected political officials] give US preselected canidates to vote on so "we" choose witch of the presented options THEY give US. So they this play mind-fuck game where people truely do believe we as the worlds free people are together deciding through this little"what do u wanna do huny? u decide"ol' trick: much like a parent gives a child, you can pick!! a., b., c., or d. its YOUR decision you pick... WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE: not even in fine print, BUT if u read BETWEEN the LINES it clearly is almost like saying ya go ahead and vote for WHOMEVER YOU WANT but they just cant say that or the mindpower/control will be lost. they have SOOO MANY DISTRACTIONs to keep us all happy and busy and do just what they want. they very treat us like we are all individual crazy/guilty persons while the finger remains pointed at us for fear we may turn it around they create laws to keep the majority of us behind bars or hiding indoors for fear of police whom intarigate, harrass and search with no warning at any time for whatever reasons they make up. the country we live in today is not close to what it was created for nor anywhere near compariable to what our founding fathers intended this place to be like. it is almost as if we are commited to kings and its 16th century london but only with technology, womens rights and a grip more rules to follow. emily: It seems like people r 2 rapped up n their own lives to pay attention or even fight whats going on. People r scared to lose their jobs. So many people, r concerned about irrelevant things. So, when u think u found others whom u could join and get some type of march going, they throw in unrelated issues like abortion or whose gonna win the election. We needed to stop this before the election, by the time the election come whats done is done That is true but we as the people need to put a stop to the madness we need to stand together they need us like we need them.damn girl you just killed my eyeswsdfjneurovbnerpivijervnerovohjewrvnrnrvrejfirjverpipverk;gjsrs;

0 Michele Bachmann's rival reaps benefits of her 'Hardball' comments LA Times, 10/23/08  By P.J. Huffstutter  Reporting from Blaine, Minn. â Elwyn Tinklenberg is living the long-shot candidate's political dream.  There weren't enough chairs for the volunteers crammed inside the four-room campaign office Wednesday morning. Every time aides hit "refresh" on their computers, hundreds more online donations appeared. Downstairs, the postal carrier spent 10 minutes trying to cram a two-foot stack of envelopes stuffed with checks into the mail slot.  "It's been raining money," said Beth DeZiel, 39, the campaign's dazed deputy finance director. "There's so much, we can barely keep up. It's unbelievable."  But this unsolicited good fortune -- $1.3 million since Friday -- isn't based on anything the Democratic former mayor and grandfather of seven did. It's all because of something his rival, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, said.  On Friday afternoon, Bachmann appeared on MSNBC's "Hardball with Chris Matthews" and made what has been dubbed the million-dollar mistake: Bachmann, 52, alleged that presidential candidate Barack Obama may hold "anti-American" views, and proposed a media investigation into "the views of the people in Congress [to] find out: Are they pro-America or anti-America?"  While Sen. Obama's presidential bid has transformed the way campaigns use the Internet to reach volunteers and donors, the technology has also become a way for the public to instantly react -- even to races in which they can't vote.  Those quick reactions, often in the form of donations, can influence the outcome of a campaign, said Julie Barko Germany, director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.  Barko German said "the Internet can be an amplifier," enabling viewers to react instantly to something that incites strong support or fury.  "It's an excellent fundraising tool," she added, citing research indicating that "when you show someone a video online, they donate 10% more."  Bachmann's interview has turned the race into one of the country's most intensely watched. It also unleashed an online backlash against Bachmann, who many local political observers assumed would easily win reelection.  President Bush won the district in 2004 with 57% of the vote. In 2006, former state Sen. Bachmann was heralded as the first female Republican to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the district, which is dominated by blue-collar and farming communities.  And this summer, one of the few polls conducted in the race showed that Bachmann held a 13-point lead over Tinklenberg.  But on Wednesday, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled all of its TV advertising supporting Bachmann in the 6th District, according to a GOP source. Since her "Hardball" appearance, Bachmann's lawn signs have been vandalized. Callers spew profanity at volunteers and obscenities about the congresswoman at her district campaign office.  Bachmann has retreated from her statements at nearly every campaign stop. She blamed the brouhaha on falling into a "trap" she said Matthews laid for her, and on having her words twisted by bloggers.  "This has been a game of telephone gone into overdrive -- nothing more," said Bachmann spokeswoman Michelle Marston. "A week ago, our competitor had no name identification. If they think that they'll win by throwing a million dollars worth of mud, I can tell you right now it won't be enough."  Marston said Bachmann's campaign also had seen a jump in contributions, from sympathetic donors who feel she's being unfairly targeted. But Marston said she didn't know the specific amount.  At the time Bachmann was on "Hardball," Tinklenberg was watching a college hockey game and stumping for votes in the bleachers. The cheers drowned out the sound of his cellphone ringing.  "By the time I looked at it, my voice mail was full," said Tinklenberg, 58, who served as Gov. Jesse Ventura's transportation commissioner from 1999 to 2002 and now works as a transportation consultant.  "It was family, friends, neighbors, supporters," Tinklenberg said. "Everyone was asking, 'Did you see what she said?' "  Since then, the campaign -- whose eight staff members had gone Dumpster-diving for office furniture and the wire wickets used for lawn signs -- has become flush.  The majority of the funds have come electronically. Of the more than 20,000 online donations, 3,210 came from Minnesota. An additional 2,405 people donated from California, and 2,330 from Texas.  Thousands of people have called the campaign office, offering up their credit card numbers. Some gave the maximum $2,300, but most offered far smaller amounts, $3 or $5, along with a message of support and an apology for not being able to give more.  "I'm a registered Republican and I have never made contributions to political campaigns," wrote one 66-year-old donor. "I wish I could send more." In a greeting card with a fuzzy white kitten on the front, another donor wrote, "What your opponent said on Chris Matthews was sickening! Hope you can defeat her!"  People who said they couldn't afford to give cash have been dropping off food for Tinklenberg and the staff -- platters of apple strudel, pots of chicken noodle soup, paper bags stuffed with oatmeal cookies.  Now, Tinklenberg said, the campaign is trying to find ways to spend so much money in so little time, so he can get out his message on ways to attract jobs, improve public infrastructure and expand public transportation options. His staff is frantically contacting local TV and radio stations to snap up available advertisement spots, installing more phone lines and placing orders for stacks of boxes of campaign literature.  "I'm not happy she said what she said," Tinklenberg said. "But we certainly are benefiting from it."  Huffstutter is a Times staff writer.  ------------------------------------------     Here is the Anti-American Tinklenberg's website where you can give til' it hurts.   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!   If Tinklenberg wins, I will be gloating for years.I don't care how often I have to shamelessly bump this this weekend.  This is too important not to be on the front page.  GO ELWYN!!!       Here is what she actually said.  Since then the GOP has yanked ads in her district, the Dems have thrown in $1Million in advertising on top of all the cash this guy has gotten directly.It is a sad day to see that Joe McCarthy's heirs are still around.  And from the same area too.  He raised $1,000,000 or so in a the last year before thursday of last week.  He has SINCE raised $1,200,000 in ONE WEEK, more than his incumbent opponent.   That's me baby.  F*** YEAH.everybody sing it with me..."Amuricahhhh...FUCK YEAH !!"   Heh, I posted this on the OBama national website too. Got at least one other person to donate.  I'm pumped.  Wow! There are over 2,000 of you? Are you pumped because he nails talking points so well...or that it will be at least a month before he becomes a typical member of Congress?

I'm sure it's incredibly early to tell, but is this the beginning of the splits of the Republican Party?  Not only is his last name "Tinklenberg" his first name is "Elwyn". Not that I give a crap, but it isn't one of those strong Anglo-Saxon names that looks good on a ballot.  He seems to be a pretty decent guy nonetheless, from the debate transcripts I read.  A solid moderate democrat, and not a partisan hack.  TINKLENBERG 08!!

And when are the "Senate Sub-Committee on UnAmerican Activities" hearings going to start back up?Â  Because they were such a hoot the last time!!!  I'm sure it's incredibly early to tell, but is this the beginning of the splits of the Republican Party?  Not only is his last name "Tinklenberg" his first name is "Elwyn". Not that I give a crap, but it isn't one of those strong Anglo-Saxon names that looks good on a ballot.  He seems to be a pretty decent guy nonetheless, from the debate transcripts I read.  A solid moderate democrat, and not a partisan hack.  TINKLENBERG 08!!  I'm not sure if it is a split, but I think the GOP will have to wander in the wilderness for a few years to find itself again at the very least.

0 which will must likely prepare you for a high-paying job :  a right major  or  the right schoolwell it depends, pretty much a combination of both. if you major in psychology at a major party school compared to an ivy league school, then your chances of making more money lessen. it also depends on what major you plan on going into. if your school is reputable for whatever major you want to pursue then yea go for it.I think its the school, because its the school that provides you the enviornment where you can network and get your contacts established, which leads to job oppurtunities.Both are important, but i think the major is even more so... depends on what jobs are available what is needed, if a teacher is needed they are going to look for a teacher, historian they will look for a history major... it all goes, there is less you can do wiith a communications degree then you can do with an education degreeDoes it rally matter?

I dont really care how much I get paid, as long as its enough to live off of n stuff,,, my school is teaching me how to do the job I wanna do very well,,, what more could I ask for? :)If you were an employer and had two people applying for a job; one from Dartmouth and one from devry; who would you rather have?Journalism/Chicano Studies is my major..I saw its a combo of both really.The right MajorThe right school. Most people don't even have a job that has to do with their major or degree..The right degree and the right university and good results...oh and good practical experience!!!

However, it's also how dedicated you are. You could have graduated from "podunk" (not a real school) but if you really put dedication into your job and show pride, you are likely to go far! People notice work ethic, mainly because so few of us have any. A little goes a long way! That's my opinion.

I would place him above Welles, Godard, Dreyer, Bergman, Fellini and Bunuel, and that's saying quite a bit.Stanley Kubrick, and seeing "Clockwork Orange" as a teenager were what made me start to study film as a potential art form, not just the Hollywood products shoved into release dates that I was used to up until that point (and that, more and more, movies tend towards now). It was just so unique and powerful, and in a way, through its own antisocial nature, it gave me the strength to get through those uncertain high school years, where I often felt caged up and institutionalized like Alex.

I wrote like 2 papers on it in college.    Although I for one think filmmakers are far too casual with releasing Special Edition DVD versions of movies these days, there's one movie where it'd be really nice to see just that, so we might have something with promotional materials and essays and documentaries detailing its influence and transition to the screen, and with any luck, a commentary by Malcolm McDowell and Jan Harlan detailing their thoughts about it, and Kubrick himself (RIP, Stan).

Excellent movie, excellent book. People think I can't like both, but they're two seperate things. And I Love both.Love it!  I don't see what the problem is in liking both. Ah, I like them both, too.    
0 Stanley Kubrick, and seeing "Clockwork Orange" as a teenager were what made me start to study film as a potential art form, not just the Hollywood products shoved into release dates that I was used to up until that point (and that, more and more, movies tend towards now). It was just so unique and powerful, and in a way, through its own antisocial nature, it gave me the strength to get through those uncertain high school years, where I often felt caged up and institutionalized like Alex. A lot of people didn't understand it, wrote it off as too weird or disturbing (which it is, certainly was at the time, though times have changed), but then it's not meant to be a family film. I wrote like 2 papers on it in college.    Although I for one think filmmakers are far too casual with releasing Special Edition DVD versions of movies these days, there's one movie where it'd be really nice to see just that, so we might have something with promotional materials and essays and documentaries detailing its influence and transition to the screen, and with any luck, a commentary by Malcolm McDowell and Jan Harlan detailing their thoughts about it, and Kubrick himself (RIP, Stan).Another fan here.

The Korova milkbar sold milk-plus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.    I wish we had a Korova Milkbar here ... with Pat Roach as a bouncer.    Alex: Excuse me, Mrs. Can you please help? There's been a terrible accident! My friend's in the middle of the road bleeding to death! Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?of course what a great movie cant believe it was banned for so long, i see worse on the news, a what an ending(whispers: I prefer the book)What part are you going for? Alex, I hope :)    It's really hard to find other books like ACwO... The kinds of things that come up as 'similar' to it are Catch-22, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, Slaughterhouse-5... You could do something from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but I really wouldn't know which part. Or something from The Wasp Factory?    There are some fair monologues in American Psycho, although I guess Bateman isn't close enough to an 'Alex' to convince your teachers you could play the part...      Bravo to your school though; edgy play to attempt!!Sorry, didn't notice: you're a girl! :P Doesn't mean you can't play Alex... he IS meant to be 15, so maybe 18 y/o boys will be too mature ;)    If you're not going for that part, may I ask what are you going for?You can absolutely be Alex as a girl...I dressed as him for halloween two years in a row...I had to improvise with the costume though...you'ld be amazed at how much attention a girl in a jock strap over white quilted long johns get...I was amazed however at how small the population of people that know this movie is. Everyone I know has seen it, but people would ask what are you, I'd tell them and get this blank stare...felt like beating the crap out of them with my walking stick!!!    Welly Welly.      That rocks....did he pass out holding the cane like that ? wow he really go into the role!Last Halloween I dressed up as one of the students in Battle Royal... ah, nothing sexier than a school uniform covered in blood. Most people didnt get who I was meant to be, so I beat them with my plastic axe. Ah, happy days...Gorgosity!!!

0 The book was better.I thought The Shining was a good movie, not the best but good. Scatman Crothers was the main reason why I've seen the movie.I love The Shining....Jacks breakdown is so realistic.i only watched like the last hour of it so i didnt get the whole story but it was okDiturbing but very goodi live in the same place as the hotel it was shot in... it was a good movie if i actually read the book i bet it would be better but i didn't so i like the movie ^^The Shining is one of the few Stephen King movies I didnt think was cheesy. A great classic.the shining is class, did you notice that nicholsons wife in the film was a really bad actress, i think if they hadnt used such a strong actor as nicholson the film would have bombed.I've never understood why he's so respected. all of his movies seem cheesy to me.What makes the book so scary is Jack's slow descent into madness but a major flaw with the film is that Jack starts off as already crazy. When he smiles that famous grin with the crooked eye-brow we already know he's nuts. It takes the terror out of Jack's slow mental breakdown.

The campy 70s interior of the Overlook is killing the wicked storyline. I think if you can overlook the camp factor the movie is a true classic. I'd love to see it redone, but cant think of anyone better than Jack...  We may be the last generation to truly love this movie in all its campy classic-ness...  How sad.

I'd love to see it redone, but cant think of anyone better than Jack...  We may be the last generation to truly love this movie in all its campy classic-ness...  How sad.I Live it everyday.Except my little friends Dr.Gonzo , not Tony....lol.first off. you cant compare books and movies. there two different mediums. of course the movie is going to leave stuff out. you really just cant comapare them.    two: the movie is technically based off the book, but lets be honest, half of the story was completely changed. its almost a whole other story.    i get so tired of all these elitest book worms thinking there art is so much better them film.
0 Loved the book, not seen the film yet.    And those hedge animals were fucking creepy.Be serious now! And that corny ending - KABOOM!I love this movie, but then again I love just about all of King's movie'sI loved it, very scary, and Nicholson was brilliant in it.I love The Shining. Kubrick's vision is fantastic.

I wasn't really scared of the movies until I saw two scenes.    1. The hot naked chick turning into a old ugly woman.    2. A guy in the bear suite giving oral to some random dude.      The whole bear thing scared the shit out of me for a week!

A good film overall.

0 It had luke skywalkers missing hand in it.3 kilos of coke, a pistol and The money from when the man and woman rob the diner. (depending on which events you think take place first).That baby from 2001. And Robert DeNiro's character from Brazil. And the lyrics to "Louie, Louie." And every character from every David Lynch film.    Mystery box.A MacGuffinSome light bulb that auto on when the briefcase is open.Its the same stuff in the case from "Ronin." Salery disputes made "Ronin"'s crew to cut the stuffs appearance in that movie though.    I quite agree, this is the one explanation I heard and thought- that's it! That's what I think it is.    Backed up, of course, by the plaster, or, 'Band Aid' that's on the back of his neck, which legend says is where the Devil would pull the soul from...    Something like that anyways!    Thats what Quentin Tarrantino said in an interview once.yeah, you need to watch 'kiss me deadly' and cross it with 'repo man'.I heard a theory that its tinkerbell. Apparantly Disney and whichever studio did pulp fiction (cant remember right now) had a friendly understanding in which they would promote each others films in their own. Or something like that.    Cant remember where I read it or how valid it is but it would be cool if it was true!

Tarantino was once quizzed about the plaster/band-aid on the back of is neck, he responded by saying that Ving Rhames (Marselius Wallace) has a scar on the back of his neck, it was thought that this would be too distracting as he's a perfectionist and wanted the shot from the back of his head. Whoever made up the Devil-Removing-soul-from-back-of-next-(fact) is laughing his fucking ass of, because that has never been said in ANY documented writtings about Beelezebub (that i've found, feel free to correct me).  As for the contents of the case... Elvis's Gold Suit. Featured in Tarantino's True Romance (i know i know he only wrote it, don't feel free to correct me). Okay so i don't have much in the way of proof but this is Tarantino's quest he creates questions so people keep on talking about it for years to come. Like we're doing now.      Why is Reservoir Dogs called Reservoir Dogs?    I therefore rest my case m'lord.    Be Cool.

Okay so i don't have much in the way of proof but this is Tarantino's quest he creates questions so people keep on talking about it for years to come. Like we're doing now.      Why is Reservoir Dogs called Reservoir Dogs?    I therefore rest my case m'lord.    Be Cool.I think it was Samuel Jackson's soul!! The "Bad Mutha Fucka" glow! Sho nuf!!    Same here.    There isn't much debate over what events take place in what order. That's relatively easy to figure out in one viewing.    As for what is in the briefcase, I think people over think it. It doesn't really matter, it's sort of a fill in the blank for whatever is valuable to a gangster. Be that money, drugs, jewelry, or whatever. Just my opinion.
0 It was Marcellus' soul which could be considered his "dirty laundry". Plus that is why they made sure you saw the bandaid on the back of his neck.Yes, thaaat's realistic. Two gangsters risk it all to return life essence to their boss?! Where do you people think it up.    Come on, if anything, we are led to assume that it's either cash [the dirty laundry line] or something else of high monetary value that would be worth it.  Don't try and interpret Pulp Fiction of all films as a fantasy/sci-fi movie.    Its Quentin Tarrantino for God's sake! Since when are his films the norm? Besides that was out of his mouth, not a guess on anyone's part.It was Mr. Wallace's fairy god parents. Motherf*cking Cosmo and that B*tch Wanda!I can't beleive people are still talking about this.... well my theroies... Tarantino was once quizzed about the plaster/band-aid on the back of is neck, he responded by saying that Ving Rhames (Marselius Wallace) has a scar on the back of his neck, it was thought that this would be too distracting as he's a perfectionist and wanted the shot from the back of his head.

They'll be right in the middle of a statement and then say "HELLO", or something like it.  It's a way to keep us ADD people paying attention. lol  Not really the same...  The object with the Breifcase, Beatrix's name is bleeped out or The Three Seashells Mystery is to keep you thinking about the movie long after the movie is over. It plays in your head as you try to figure out the mystery or you come up with your own conclusions... :)Everyone knows this was in the briefcase:  Everyone should know this was in the briefcase:  ALL WRONG! HeHeHeHeHeHeHe!! It's Elvis' gold suit. Duh, even I knew that!

0 Anyone can advise me some good recent horror movies, because everything I saw was bad and I always stick to the classics from 70s or 80s...nothing is really a horror movie these days. how long has it been since you have seen a film that has seriously scared the crap out of you? although 'stay alive' i will admit is a little creepy..have you seen that?I'll check Stay Alive then... I heard it was not too bad. Last movie that scared me? I would say Dark Water (original japanese)... not since. Last one I saw was the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, it sucks.Have you seen A Tale of Two Sisters? Scary, and makes you think.is it the one with two twin sisters? from Korea or Thailand?    For A Tale of Two Sisters ... yes, it's Korean.uzumaki  its a sweet movie    Yeah I saw it, it is indeed a great movie. Korean's best one remains Old Boy although!!yes  oldboy  owns everything  not really horror, but an excellent film nonethelessSlither and Feast. Fun, campy horror movies, underrated or unseen but worth the time and effort in acquiring. Forget all these pseudo horror movies coming out recently.    And if you like Zombie movies. George Romero is the go to guy. All his movies are social commentaries as well as zombie eating good times.

I get scared too easily, So me tell u a scary movie u probly wouldnt even flintch.    But I do Have to agree with u, The scariest movies are the ones from back in the Day, It, Shinning.. Shit like that i definetly can not watch.. Saw 1 and 2 I thought was made really good. I havent seen 3 yet.. What scare me most about those movies are those are actually real devices that were used to kill people..(spanish tortuing devices) .. Scary!!!!!

Creepy kids and herky-jerky dead people used to get me going, but the herky-jerky stuff has become a cottage industry. People who use it now should pay a royalty.

I love those.  Plus, I love all the gore. :DI hated the original Hostel.  Hopefully Hostel 2 is better. I'm definitely going to go see it.    I think Turistas is going to be good."shutter"(like ju-on) or "r-point"  great korean movies
0     Im Sorry The Hill have eyes Scared the Freaking shit out of me! i wont watch it again! lol.    i watched 60 most scary movies on bravo and they said Hostel was number 1! I get scared too easily, So me tell u a scary movie u probly wouldnt even flintch.    But I do Have to agree with u, The scariest movies are the ones from back in the Day, It, Shinning.. Shit like that i definetly can not watch.. Saw 1 and 2 I thought was made really good. I havent seen 3 yet.. What scare me most about those movies are those are actually real devices that were used to kill people..(spanish tortuing devices) .. Scary!!!!!The Descent is scary.    I never saw the Japanese version of The Grudge, but the American version just seemed to be a boo movie. I wondered if the Japanese movie had a stronger story thread.    Creepy kids and herky-jerky dead people used to get me going, but the herky-jerky stuff has become a cottage industry. People who use it now should pay a royalty.Here's a Korean horror film.    The Isle (2000)  24th May 05    Plot  A lonely mute woman and a man on the run find love and pain amidst the fishing huts of a tranquil fishing lake.how can someone like cabin fever?? it's the worst movie ever.Have you seen the movie May? Wasnt really scary but it was pretty disturbing..    I have yet to see any really scary movies latly. i think I may be immune to horror now.    cabin fever n hostle were the shit. i love movies like that that havent been done and are based in some sort of reality. it could happen.The Audition is pretty creepy the other asian movies that I've seen that creep me out are:  Ju-On  Suicide Circle  Tell Me Something  Three    It's one of those horror comedies.

0 Definitely Christopher Reeve as Superman.  Tobey as Spiderman.  I also loved Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman...(although, that is television...)Mike Keaton>>>>Christian Bale as the bat. Nothing against Bale but not only were Tim Burtons Batman films easily better then Batman Returns but Keton WAS Batman.Problem with today's superhero movies. Superheroes are invincible, smart, and with out a flaw. Why do we portray them as people with tragic flaws, like Spiderman movies. I mean is a super hero supposed to bitch or cry about MJ? Shouldn't he be out there stopping villains and explaining logic and philosphy to their sidekicks?    Well you must've never read a spider-man comic in your life. Spider-man is all about the flaws, that's what makes him a great super hero.    For character portrayal I'd say that Christopher Reeves is top of the list.christian bale as batmanchristopher reeve as superman  michael keaton as batman  keanu reeves as neoRon Jeremy as Jizz Master ZeroAlan Cumming - Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler in X2: Xmen United    Quality opening scene!Thomas Jane as The Punisher. I can't wait to see the next one.    But Bale was awesome as well as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I can't wait to see him add some more layers in the next film.

If they were all invincible, what fun would it be? It would all be the same. Bad guy threatens city, good guy gets bad guy without getting scratched...end of story. That would be a sucky movie.

0 im gonna put my vote for bale as batman, however I did prefer tim burtons direction. wish he would do another one.    I have to say i was terribly disappointed with maguire as spiderman. in my mind, from reading the comics and watching the cartoons as i grew up Peter Parker was not a whining lil dork but a confident witty and highly intelligent kid, trying to make his way day to day and putting up with hassels of his home life.    i just found it sad that intelligence was veiwed as "geekiness"    Go back and look at 1960's Spider-Man comics. That's what they're going for in the movies. And he was a geek. A skinny, brainy geek that suddenly got powers. I think Tobey nailed that.Trey Parker as Orgazmo.  Damon Wayans as Blank Man.

0 yup      Nope :) If they're going to have a black james bond they need to make sure it's the dude that played opposite the other dude in Equilibrium . . man I can't remember anybody's name right now.Taye DiggsAnd I've never liked them chaning up characters from history like they did with the Green Lantern. They don't need to make a black James Bond. They just need to come out with a completely fresh and new Spy series with a new black character. Starting with Taye Diggs :)I'll watch anything with Denzel, he's a great actorDenzel is definetely awesome, but do y'all not think he'd bee a bit too old for James Bond?Eh, he doesnt look to old, i wouldnt mind seeing him tryWHY THE HELL would they have a black 007!?????    Are you forgetting that James Bond is a character from Ian Fleming's famous series of spy novels!? James Bond is famously a WHITE guy! It's rediculous to change the colour of his skin. Its nothing racial, simply respectful to Fleming's character!so your saying make James Bond an ever angry black man?    Sorry,  Denzel is not that good of an actor. He has about the same range as Bruce Willis. Bond is not an American character so the actor should not be American.    You want a good angry black man movie, have these well known people in it:  Denzel Washington  Samuel Jackson  Laurence Fishburn  Jada Pinkett Smith (as a side kick so she is extra angry)  and you will have a sure fire hit on the strength.    Plus the actor playing Bond is usually British. So Denzel fails anyway, even if they were to have a black bond it would be a British black actor.

Not for any reasons people knee jerk about, but because we have a history with James Bond. Don't go messin that up. As the other person said already, create a whole new character and series. Sort of like they did with XxX.

Not to sound racial but it should stay that way or it'd change everything that is James Bond. Can you imagine someone like Jet Li being James Bond? It just would be James Bond anymore.

I am not even going to get into his newer stuff because he is just an angry black man. Like I said, as much range as Bruce Willis, no matter what he does, its Bruce Willis. No matter what Denzel does, its just Denzel. Not hating on the guy, just call it as I see it.    As a person, he is a good fella. A buddy of mine has worked with him a few times, most recently on Deja Vu. Denzel can play a practical joke and take one as well. Not easily said for the likes of Tom Cruise.

I figured they caved under political correctness. But somebody told me that there are 100s of Green Lanterns from another planet.    But when there is a historical track record of a character, keep him the way he has always been (or her).But for the oringinal ? no i don't think he should i think he would be great in it but james bond anit even american.However if he can get the british accent down i don't see why not because there are black people that live in europe so i wouldn't have a problem with it.i think emmanuel lewis should be the next bond    Id love to see this they could get someone like wee man or maybe the guy who played mini me!lol,  lakeland,  dude,  get a clue.        Get a clue about what?Your denzel sucks opinion is based on nothing why does he suck in your opinon?Name one movie he has gave a bad performence in?no problem, I'll give you two Carbon Copy and Virtuosity.    I am not even going to get into his newer stuff because he is just an angry black man. Like I said, as much range as Bruce Willis, no matter what he does, its Bruce Willis. No matter what Denzel does, its just Denzel. Not hating on the guy, just call it as I see it.    As a person, he is a good fella. A buddy of mine has worked with him a few times, most recently on Deja Vu. Denzel can play a practical joke and take one as well. Not easily said for the likes of Tom Cruise.    Okay Carbon copy was his first movie alot of great actor's dont give good performance's in thier first movie and Virtuosity was a bad movie all together so your is still invalid.So are you saying the guy has no talent or you just you don't like his style?

In other words, you can not imagine anyone else in the role such as Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.      as far as my two picks of bad films being invalid, nope, you asked for one I gave you two, lol.

Harrison Ford is the last great classic action star no doubt about it.    As far as Training Day, anyone pretty much could step right into that role.

Malcolm X,  You first need to realise and understand, was a real person. All you need to do with when portraying a real person is impersonate them. There is plenty of footage of the real person to study from. He did not create a character, he impersonated a person. Maybe its just me but there is enough drama in real life to sit down and watch someone else's drama on film. I tried watching Malcolm X and just couldnt do it, boring and just uninteresting to me personaly but o each their own.    Pretty much any actor will tell you, drama is easy, comedy is hard.

Pretty much any actor will tell you, drama is easy, comedy is hard.    if they have a black bond, nobody would be cooler than don cheadle.mos def.your all missing the main point here , , BOND IS"NT BLACK , his parents were scottish and swiss , , and no matter how mant political correct kudos it gets you, bond is a white western european , so deal with it.    Denzel is great!! I don't think he'd be too old. He looks a lot younger than Daniel Craig (who happens to be 38 but looks almost 60).
0 ooohh,  your onto something there!  How about a Puerto Rican James Bond and the Bond girl is his sister that all the villains are trying to sleep with hence forth the plot.    That's what I was thinking. That doesn't make any damn sense. Plus Bond fans would be pissed. Hell, I'm not even a Bond fan and I'd still be pissed.    How about that James Bond is white?    A black James Bond wouldn't work. A spy film with a black guy in it would, but James Bond is white. You might as well make James Bond a transexual with one leg as well. And set it in 13th Century Wales. It's the same as all those idiots wanting a woman to play Doctor Who-it would feel 'wrong'.        Harrison Ford?Hahaha.Idiana jones had no good acting he ran and jumped and look for shit.I mean you speak about great character's.Have you seen training day i think he gave some life to that movie he made ethan hawke who is a great actor look like It was his first movie.Not to mention malcolm X how can you see that movie and not say denzel is one of the best?Obviously you didnt read what I wrote, it was an example.  Can you imagine Indiana Jones played by anyone other than Harrison Ford. Can you imagine Indy played by Tom Sellick because thats who the part was written as and for, Magnum PI. Harrison Ford is the last great classic action star no doubt about it.    As far as Training Day, anyone pretty much could step right into that role. Yes I have seen it and still to this day wonder why anyone can see it as a great film. Ethan Hawk is a great actor? When did this happen? Not sure we watched the same film or is it the age gap?    Malcolm X,  You first need to realise and understand, was a real person. All you need to do with when portraying a real person is impersonate them. There is plenty of footage of the real person to study from. He did not create a character, he impersonated a person. Maybe its just me but there is enough drama in real life to sit down and watch someone else's drama on film. I tried watching Malcolm X and just couldnt do it, boring and just uninteresting to me personaly but o each their own.

Denzel is great!! I don't think he'd be too old. He looks a lot younger than Daniel Craig (who happens to be 38 but looks almost 60).all of the previous Bonds had an older look and thats how it should be, life experianced with nothing to lose.

0 I agree, Ken has worked in London for a long time and I do partly benefit from his work so ..  Voting Ken here! =DMeh, I hit my B Day before the elections but I know the majority in mine don't care for politics, pity but I don't think I could change their mind :)  Then again .. I could threaten our free transport may be changed under the other two :DIm only a Labour supporter when its a choice between Tory and Labour. Then again, who does like tories, I haven't met 1 teen that likes conservative yet.  And yeah, I may just do that.hmm,   i can appreciate what your both saying esp if you have benefitted from his decisions   i think london is better now than it was before him, lookin back london was a grimey place not long ago, it still has its problems but there are a lot more good points than there a few years ago  but this is whatÂ i think about ken, he is essentially a gambler, a lot of the projects he has launched are with borrowed money, that means that the project needs to pay for itself or WE get the bill, you wont get this bill through the mail, everything else will slowly get more expensive,   my personal opinion is that ken hasnt opened THAT many doors for londoners, just a few more for the those who can afford it,  ive worked in a lot of places with a whole range of people andÂ ive worked with some reprobates, people so thick its painful to look at them at times  i can only assume that its notÂ that hard to find work, it just depends on how badly u want the work or what your pride will allow you to do,  i wouldnt vote for him just cos i worked for him directly or indirectly, job is a job is a job, u could just as easily get work for a construction or media company with a conservative on the board of directors   my point is tho, i dont know if kens gambles will pay off,Â i hope so, but ultimately it is out of our hands and time will tell,  if tony blair and his lot are anything to go by, we could be in trouble   boris is funny at times, and i think his bufoonery is exagerated as he is reported to have a good business record, but i dont trust the tories,    going on personalities i think ken has had his turn, a lot of blind eyes have been turned and he will get caught soon doing something that could effect our reputation,  boris is a mug ken is a c*nt the liberal dude is a gay copper  turd sandwich or giant douche anyone?     if he runs i might vote greg dyke who has a fantastic surname, good record, stood up to the gov when he needed to and suffered as a consequence but it showed he has some balls, he is from london, lives in london and isnt affliated to any of the partysive not heard that boris will scrap free transport,   is that free transport for who? old people, i dont think he would be allowed to do that, people would screwinfact who apart from old and disabledÂ people get free transport?  i never had free transport ever,   infact this last week has cost me about 140 quid because of a broken oyster machine and its knock on effects  theres me sluggin my guts out and ppl get free transport?   im gettin sick ofÂ TFL, they treat you like cattle and mug youÂ off when something goes wrong and it neverÂ endsÂ    infact that settles it, im not voting for ken purely because of TFL, they disgust me as a company, and the worst thing is I am dependant on them....Â I give them money everyday    lol  the first point is quite an outlandish claim to make, boris has only mentioned london in the house of commons once, are you sure?????   i agree the fact he is from london and always lived hereÂ is a good point, but it doesnt mean he hasnt been filling his boots at our expense in the meantime like the rest of them, ken brought in bob from new york to sort out the tube, the guy was a raging alcoholic who had a breakdown, did an interview in the standard saying he hasnt done anything and is still gettin paid     Ouch, poor you.  I dunno about you but I get free transport. I love me oyster card tho It is a bitch replacing it if it gets lost.  Oyster card? Bare in mind I'm out in the sticks and we're behind the times.........  We've only just replaced the horse and cart with one of these new fangled bus contraptions......  Lol, Oyster card :)  ..  Like so. Has your picture and name and as Im 17 and in education, I get free transport.

And yeah, I may just do that.hmm,   i can appreciate what your both saying esp if you have benefitted from his decisions   i think london is better now than it was before him, lookin back london was a grimey place not long ago, it still has its problems but there are a lot more good points than there a few years ago  but this is whatÂ i think about ken, he is essentially a gambler, a lot of the projects he has launched are with borrowed money, that means that the project needs to pay for itself or WE get the bill, you wont get this bill through the mail, everything else will slowly get more expensive,   my personal opinion is that ken hasnt opened THAT many doors for londoners, just a few more for the those who can afford it,  ive worked in a lot of places with a whole range of people andÂ ive worked with some reprobates, people so thick its painful to look at them at times  i can only assume that its notÂ that hard to find work, it just depends on how badly u want the work or what your pride will allow you to do,  i wouldnt vote for him just cos i worked for him directly or indirectly, job is a job is a job, u could just as easily get work for a construction or media company with a conservative on the board of directors   my point is tho, i dont know if kens gambles will pay off,Â i hope so, but ultimately it is out of our hands and time will tell,  if tony blair and his lot are anything to go by, we could be in trouble   boris is funny at times, and i think his bufoonery is exagerated as he is reported to have a good business record, but i dont trust the tories,    going on personalities i think ken has had his turn, a lot of blind eyes have been turned and he will get caught soon doing something that could effect our reputation,  boris is a mug ken is a c*nt the liberal dude is a gay copper  turd sandwich or giant douche anyone?     if he runs i might vote greg dyke who has a fantastic surname, good record, stood up to the gov when he needed to and suffered as a consequence but it showed he has some balls, he is from london, lives in london and isnt affliated to any of the partysive not heard that boris will scrap free transport,   is that free transport for who? old people, i dont think he would be allowed to do that, people would screwinfact who apart from old and disabledÂ people get free transport?  i never had free transport ever,   infact this last week has cost me about 140 quid because of a broken oyster machine and its knock on effects  theres me sluggin my guts out and ppl get free transport?   im gettin sick ofÂ TFL, they treat you like cattle and mug youÂ off when something goes wrong and it neverÂ endsÂ    infact that settles it, im not voting for ken purely because of TFL, they disgust me as a company, and the worst thing is I am dependant on them....Â I give them money everyday    lol  the first point is quite an outlandish claim to make, boris has only mentioned london in the house of commons once, are you sure?????   i agree the fact he is from london and always lived hereÂ is a good point, but it doesnt mean he hasnt been filling his boots at our expense in the meantime like the rest of them, ken brought in bob from new york to sort out the tube, the guy was a raging alcoholic who had a breakdown, did an interview in the standard saying he hasnt done anything and is still gettin paid     Ouch, poor you.  I dunno about you but I get free transport. I love me oyster card tho It is a bitch replacing it if it gets lost.  Oyster card? Bare in mind I'm out in the sticks and we're behind the times.........  We've only just replaced the horse and cart with one of these new fangled bus contraptions......  Lol, Oyster card :)  ..  Like so.

0 Hillary got creamed by Obama.  That made me smile.  Agreed.Another great speech. Boy I'd love to see a split ticket...Paul-Obama.           .......................And Bill Clinton. Which is why Ted Kennedy is endorsing Barack and not Hillary.If he's assassinated I'm disowning America.It also fits Plato's Allegory of the Cave.I don't know about the attmpt being successful security is insane now. I met a retired secret service agent he spent 40 minutesÂ explaining the security measures that he Could tell me about.He actually jumped on reagan when that guy tried to kill him.
0 French party leader given 3 month suspended jail sentence and fined for saying Nazi occupation "wasn't that bad"...hmmm, so apparently saying something offensive in France is a crime....guess that's what happens when the PC police get control.The vichy regime is still a touchy subject, thats like if germans shouted in the german parlaiment that hitler was a swell guy, it would be bad publicity, draw negative public attention and the french dont need that. they already have their own issues they dont need the world calling them nazis just quite yet. maybe in time it wont be so taboo to talk about the Vichy regime but right now theres still alot of people that remeber it first handI remember when Farley Mowat (canadian writer) was banned from entering the US, dubbed as a communist, because he wrote about how wolves were not the killers that people feared.Does anyone know how many venues in the US Marilyn Manson has been banned from...or Lamb of God??"The Most Frequently Banned Books in the 1990s" This list is taken from the table of contents of Banned in the U.S.A. by Herbert N.

You're right -- the students would benefit from learning about right from wrong. False accusations are wrong.Â  Accusations based on circumstance with no proof are wrong.Â  Taking the authority of law into your own hands is wrong.Â  You think they got those lessons?  Most schools have a policy regard handling of cash.Â  I'd guess it was a violation of the policy to keep the money (no matter how small the amount) in an unsecured location at the school.  It could have been another teacher, a janitor or any other adult to take the money -- it could have even been mistakenly mixed up with other papers or thrown out (have you ever seen a teacher's desk in the middle of the day?)  In the public climate that exists regarding 'touching' students these days Im amazed that any educator would even go there.

That guy must really hate his ex wife.Teacher must have been really hard up for her latte.Probably if you stole 5 bucks worth of candy from Wal-Mart they would just make you pay out of pocket and not strip you down.  Wow.Â  Really you would just say, go ahead and violate my rights?Â  So if a cop pulls you over and ask you to let him search you car, will you let him?Â  Or a cop comes to your home and asks to search your home will you let him?Â  I mean he has no reason to and no warrant.Â  You would still let him because he is doing his job?  I would wait for the warrant.Â  Especially when I know I am innocent.Â  I am just in shock by your statement.Â  I cannot believe you do not value your rights.  Maybe you were joking.Â  Were you?^ Nope.  I think it was Mitch Hedburg who said "I like the UPS guy, cause he's a drug dealer and he doesn't even know it."If I were the teacher, I would tell them I just created a MASSIVE project for them out of thin air. Anyone who tells me who took the money gets an automatic 100 and doesn't have to do it.Dood... WTF??!?! Â  This is another reason why, when I have kids, they will go to private schools.

There are exceptions to the 4th Amendment in relation to public schools. Read this:  Public Schools .--In New Jersey v. T.L.O.,  108 the Court set forth the principles governing searches by public school authorities. The Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by public school officials because ''school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents.''  109 However, ''the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.''  110 Neither the warrant requirement nor the probable cause standard is appropriate, the Court ruled. Instead, a simple reasonableness standard governs all searches of students' persons and effects by school authorities.  111 A search must be reasonable at its inception, i.e., there must be ''reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.''  112 School searches must also be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference, and ''not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.''  113 In applying these rules, the Court upheld as reasonable the search of a student's purse to determine whether the student, accused of violating a school rule by smoking in the lavatory, possessed cigarettes. The search for cigarettes uncovered evidence of drug activity held admissible in a prosecution under the juvenile laws.     Click here for source

Instead, a simple reasonableness standard governs all searches of students' persons and effects by school authorities.  111 A search must be reasonable at its inception, i.e., there must be ''reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.''  112 School searches must also be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference, and ''not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.''  113 In applying these rules, the Court upheld as reasonable the search of a student's purse to determine whether the student, accused of violating a school rule by smoking in the lavatory, possessed cigarettes. The search for cigarettes uncovered evidence of drug activity held admissible in a prosecution under the juvenile laws.

0 I enjoy his films, most are action films but Lock Stock is my favorite of all.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels  What a movie! The ending is too much, meaning I liked it. I agree on the typecast and the agent. Thought about this over dinner and I think maybe the action films do suit him. He can say a lot with the expression on his face and his movies aren't slowed down by a lot of dialogue. I don't necessary like all the hand to hand combat but I can tolerate it because I know he'll win and look good doing it. Watched this movie 2 x's in 4 days liked it. In 1971 London, a car dealer and his gang of thieves break into a bank vault and find far more than cash and jewelry. Saffron Burrows plays a good role in this Action Crime drama Thriller. Based on a true story. One of the Largest heist in History. F.Y.I.- It came to the Cinemas on Friday, March 7th, 2008 not the 9thHe's great. I loved him in War, which would have been an awesome movie if the ending wasn't such a fail.  Nice to know there are others out there who like him too.  that new guy ritchie movie he was in "revolver" is soooooo good. sure again statham is a tough guy, but it sheds here in this movie. i used to say lock stock was his best role but revolver now is really his best work. Cool it's on the list for todays D.V.D.'s to find. It's on dvd right?yes ma'am and to be honest, it's a buy. you'll really love this movie since you're a statham fan

0 yes ma'am and to be honest, it's a buy. you'll really love this movie since you're a statham fan Thanks!I watched Revolver last night... And it is really good. The critics that ripped on it and called it a mess are wrong. Sure, it's complicated and might confuse some, but so what. Personally, I loved it.  if there was one thing i didn't like it was the very end when they were rolling the credits. i don't know if they have that commentary by doctors and specialists at the end in the dvd release but they did have it in the theatrical release and it annoyed me for some reason. i think it's because it just started to feel a little blow hardy and didn't allow me to think for myself you know? it felt like it was kinda laying things down for me.Just watchedÃÂ ÃÂ  WAR  Jet LiÃÂ  andÃÂ  Jason Statham  One wants Justice.

0 Fallon 'may lose job over Iran war'  Adm.William Fallon, the head of the US Central Command, may lose his jobfor opposing President Bush's plans to wage war against Iran. According to a new Esquirearticle by Thomas Barnett; Admiral Fallon may be prematurely 'relievedof his command' as soon as this summer to be replaced with a more'pliable' commander.  "If that were to happen, it maywell mean that the president and vice-president intend to take militaryaction against Iran before the end of this year and don't want acommander standing in their way," says the article which will bepublished on March 12.  Admiral Fallon, who has beennamed as 'one of the best strategic thinkers in uniform today' byDefense Secretary Robert Gates, opposed the troops surge in Iraq andhas consistently battled with President George W. Bush to avertconfrontation with Iran.  The Navy admiral has vowed thatan attack on Iran would 'not happen on his watch', calling the WhiteHouse warmongering echelons 'not helpful'.  Washington and its allies are at loggerheads with the Islamic Republic over the country's nuclear standoff with the West.  TheBush administration accuses Iran of pursuing nuclear weaponry, whileTehran maintains its uranium enrichment will only provide fuel for thecountry's under-construction nuclear power plants.  PresidentBush insists the military option against Iran remains on the table,while his top military experts, including Admiral Fallon, urge theWhite House to choose a diplomatic approach towards Tehran.  In a Thursday White House press briefing, spokeswoman Dana Perino was asked about the Esquire piece and refused to confirm whether Fallon's position is secure until the end of his tenure.I guess he's too liberal for them, like Peter Pace, whose term - one of the shortest in history - as chairman of the joint chiefs, ended soon after he argued that evidence of Iranian military hardware in Iraq is not evidence of their state sanction, at least not at the highest levels. that apparently, didn't go over well at the neocon nerve center (pentagon).they don't like to be contradicted. that's been clear since day 1 and is probably why 9/11 happened as well...due to their stubborness and idiocy.  fallon may well be, as one of the articles below delves into, the only man standing between us and full out world war.

An Admiral Takes on the White House By Gareth Porter Go to Original Washington - A new article on CENTCOM commander Adm. William Fallonconfirms that his public statements last fall ruling out war againstIran last fall were not coordinated with the White House and landed himin trouble more than once with President George W. Bush and VicePresident Dick Cheney. In anadmiring article on Fallon in Esquire, former Pentagon official ThomasP.M. Barnett writes that Fallon angered the White House by "brazenlychallenging" Bush on his aggressive threat of war against Tehran.Barnett also cites "well-placed observers" as saying Bush may soonreplace Fallon with a "more pliable" commander. Barnett's account, which quotes conversations with Fallon during theCENTCOM commander's trips to the Middle East, shows that Fallonprivately justified his statements contradicting the Bush policy ofkeeping the "option" of an unprovoked attack on Iran "on the table" asnecessary to calm the fears of Egypt and other friendly Arab regimes ofa US-Iran war. Barnett recalls thatwhen Fallon was in Cairo in November, the lead story in that day'sedition of the English-language daily Egyptian Gazette carried theheadline "US Rules Out Strike against Iran" over a picture of Fallonmeeting with President Hosni Mubarak. That story, published Nov. 19 and not picked up by any US news media,reported that Fallon had "ruled out a possible strike against Iran andsaid Washington was mulling nonmilitary options instead." Later that day, according to Barnett, Fallon told him during a coffeebreak in a military meeting, "I'm in hot water again," and thenconfirmed that his problems were directly with the White House. That was the second time in less than a week and the third time inseven weeks that Fallon had publicly declared that there would be nowar against Iran. In an interview with Al-Jazeera television inSeptember, which Fallon himself had requested, according to a source atAl-Jazeera, he had said, "This constant drum beat of conflict is whatstrikes me which is not helpful and not useful." And only a week before the trip to Egypt, in an interview withFinancial Times, Fallon had said, a military strike was not "in theoffing," adding, "Another war is just not where we want to go." These statements represented an extraordinary exercise of power by acombat commander, because it contradicted a central feature of theBush-Cheney strategy on Iran. High-ranking Bush administrationofficials had been routinely repeating the administration's line thatno option had been taken "off the table" since early 2005. At an Oct. 17 news conference, Bush said he had "told people that ifyou're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought tobe interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary tomake a nuclear weapon." Fallon'spublic statements explicitly ruling out an attack on Iran thusundermined the Bush administration's threat against Iran. The willingness of the top commander in the Middle East to take themilitary option "off the table" was in part a reflection of thedetermination of uniformed military leaders to prevent what theyregarded as a disastrous course. Thenew chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, whoreplaced Gen. Peter Pace in June, was even more candid about hisopposition to the use of force against Iran than Pace had been,according to a Congressional staffer who had participated in privatemeetings with both. Pace declared publicly in late October, "We have tobe mindful of the risks that would [be spawned] by engaging in a thirdconflict" in the region. Mullen added, however, that military options "cannot be taken off the table." But Fallon, as the commander responsible for the entire Middle East,was concerned about more than the consequences of actually exercisingthe military option. He was prompted to enunciate a "no-war" line onIran by the panicky reactions of Arab states to what they thought wereindications of the warlike intentions of Bush administration. In the latter half of 2007 friendly Arab regimes were upset by thepossibility of a US-Iran war, which they feared would destabilize theentire region. Fallon is quoted as telling Barnett, "[I]t's all anyonewants to talk about right now. People here hear what I'm saying andunderstand. I don't want to get them too spun up." Fallon told Barnett that his ruling out of military action against Iranwas necessary to calm the very regimes the Bush administration washoping to enlist to support its anti-Iran line. "Washington interpretsthis as all aimed at them," Fallon said in Cairo, according to Barnett."Instead, it's aimed at governments and media in this region. I'm nottalking about the White House." Fallon was arguing, in effect, that it makes no sense to make thepossibility of an unprovoked attack part of your declaratory policy ifmerely induces confusion and panic among friendly governments withoutinfluencing the target of the threat. Barnett quotes Fallon as complaining that "they" - meaning White Houseofficials - were asking him, "Why are you even meeting with Mubarak?"But Fallon strongly defended the diplomatic role he was playing inrelations with Mubarak and other Middle Eastern leaders. "This is mycenter of gravity," Fallon told him. "This is my job." Fallon's sensitivity to the political-diplomatic consequences of adeclaratory policy that explicitly keeps open the threat of anaggressive war as a potential option set him apart not only from theWhite House but from the consensus among national security specialistsin both parties. In early 2007, all three of the top three Democraticcontenders for the presidential nomination publicly declared theirsupport for keeping "all options on the table." Fallon is not the first CENTCOM commander to rein in aggressive WhiteHouse policy toward the Middle East. In late 1997, according to DanaPriest's book, The Mission, the Bill Clinton White House wanted CENTCOMcommander Gen. Anthony Zinni to order his pilots to provoke a militaryconfrontation with Iraq in the no-fly zone by deliberately drawing firefrom Iraqi planes. The request forsuch a provocation was conveyed to Zinni by the vice chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston. But Zinni, who believed thatit could lead to an unwanted war with Iraq, insisted that a formalrequest from the White House would have to be sent, and the plan wasdropped. The unhappiness of the Bushadministration with Fallon's role as well as the unflattering pictureof administration policy revealed by the article was evident Thursdayfrom the failure of either the White House or the Pentagon to issue theusual reassuring statements in response to the article. The White House declined to comment, although, according to theWashington Post's Thomas Ricks, the article "was being discussedthere." The Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said Secretary ofDefense Robert M. Gates "has read the profile on Admiral Fallon butchooses not to comment on it or other press accounts."

Moment on Iran  by  Dave Lindorff | March 12, 2008 - 8:18am  Everyhorrormovie has that "Oh Shit!" moment, when the hero or heroes arehuddled insome creepy hideout, and suddenly something happens thattells you thatthe monster is just around the corner, or just about toattack. In"Jurassic Park" it was the pulsing ripples in a cup ofwater, heraldingthe arrival of a T-Rex. In "Jaws" it was the deep bassmusic, lettingyou know that a monstrous shark was about to attack. Well,we justgot our "Oh Shit!" moment with the just-announced resignationof AdmiralWilliam J. Fallon, the military commander of US Middle Eastoperations. Adm.Fallon, 63, famously said that an attack onIran would not happen "on mywatch," and is widely believed to havealready threatened, along with anumber of other top generals andadmirals, to quit the service if theBush administration were to launchan air attack on Iran. Put thepieces together. We know that thevice president is obsessed with adesire to attack Iran, and has beensince before he even took office.Bush has repeatedly stressed thatIran cannot be permitted to continuewith its nuclear processing (hecalls it their "nukular" bomb program,though there is no evidence thatthe country has a nuclear bombdevelopment program, and in fact thelast National Intelligence Estimateon Iran said there was not andhadn't been since 2003). And Fallon hasnow quit. The Eisenhowernuclear aircraft carrier strike forcehas departed for stationing offIran, joining forces already in placethere, and loaded to the brimwith strike aircraft, Tomahawk missiles,and even nuclear weapons. Itwas long ago reported that stealth bombershad been put in place income of the countries of the old Soviet Unionnorth of Iran, as well ason the island of Diego Garcia in the IndianOcean. All theelements, that is to say, are in place for amassive air assault onIranian targets, designed to destroy its nuclearprogram, cripple itsmilitary command and control, and--at least this isa stated Cheneygoal--to lead to the overthrow of the Iranian governmentby its ownpeople. It is, of course, the strategy of madmen. TheUShas no forces to send into Iran. All they can do is bomb it.Andbombing a country doesn't lead its people to rise up. It leads themtorally 'round the flag. Especially when the civilian casualties ofournot-so-"smart" bombs start to soar. If such an attack weretohappen, we can kiss goodbye to six years of domestic peace, suchaswe've had. The Iranians have considerable capability to inflictdamageon US targets of interest, both overseas and here in the domesticUSusing assymetrical warfare techniques. The worse part is, they'dbecompletely justified in doing so, since any attack on them would beacrime against peace--the gravest of all international crimes. Americantroopsalready mired and pinned down in a war in Iraq, would findthemselvessuddenly under attack by Shia forces there, who for severalyears nowhave been largely leaving them alone. And oil, whichjust bumpedup against $110 a barrel, an all-time record, will doublein priceovernight, as the whole Persian Gulf becomes a war zone. Wecanexpect massive launches of small boats armed with missilesandtorpedoes, as well as sophisticated anti-ship missiles fromshorebatteries, all fired at US ships in the Gulf, and it wouldbeastounding if some or even many vessels of the US fleet weren't sunk. Meanwhile,tankertraffic in the Gulf, which accounts for 20% or more of theworld's oil,will cease as insurance rates for those vessels goesthrough the roof. Themonster of war will be unleashed, and willnot easily be defeated.That's why Adm. Fallon was so opposed to thewhole idea. He knows thatit will be a disaster for the US militarily,economically andpolitically. The worst part is that Cheneyknows this, too. Hejust doesn't care. This is the man's parting shotas he leavesoffice--to put the country into the throes of a war sovicious that noone will think of pursuing him for his long list ofcrimes against thenation and the Constitution. He isguessing--and he may beright--that the American public will,sheep-like as always, rally to thecause, with a new round of yellowmagnet "ribbons" on their cars. He ishoping--and he may be right--thatwar will be a boon for the candidacyof Republican John McCain and forembattled Republicans running forCongress. It's a kind of political Hail Mary.  Source

0 Iraqi PM Gives Basra Gunmen Ultimatum Rocket Attacks Hit Green Zone  By Sholnn Freeman and Sudarsan Raghavan Washington Post Foreign Service Wednesday, March 26, 2008; 11:39 AM    BAGHDAD, March 26 -- Clashes continued Wednesday between Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias in the southern city of Basra, as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki laid down a deadline for gunmen to surrender and fresh rocket attacks hit Baghdad's Green Zone.  The U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital said that three Americans were badly hurt by the latest strikes in the Green Zone, a fortified area that houses the U.S. Embassy compound and the Iraqi government, according to the Associated Press. No further details were immediately available. Mortars and rockets have struck the Green Zone and other U.S. positions repeatedly since Sunday, with U.S. officials reporting 12 strikes Tuesday.  According to wire reports, as many as 55 people have died during the past two days in intense clashes that began in Basra as part of an Iraqi government crackdown on Shiite militias in the area, particularly the Mahdi Army of hard-line cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Violence subsequently spread to Shiite areas in Baghdad and other cities.  The operation in Basra won praise Tuesday from the White House, where spokeswoman Dana Perino referred to it as a "brave decision" by Maliki to assert Iraqi government control over an important port city that serves as the country's gateway to the Persian Gulf.  According to wire service reports, Maliki issued a statement giving gunmen in Basra three days to give up their weapons and renounce further violence. Those who don't, said a Maliki aide, will be targeted for arrest in the ongoing security operation.  Speaking about the Basra offensive, U.S. military spokesman Maj. Gen. Kevin Bergner said, "Initial reports are that they are making progress." But he cautioned that it was still too early to grade the success of the operation.  "A large part of the determination will be the citizens of Basra and how they respond," Bergner said at a briefing Wednesday in the Green Zone. He said Iraq has moved an additional 2,000 troops to Basra. A British military spokesman said Tuesday that Iraqi police and military troops in the area total 16,700, including national policemen, special forces and military police.  Bergner called the rocket attacks against the Green Zone "criminal activity" and said U.S. weapons teams had stopped eight intended rocket attacks targeting the Green Zone and located a stockpile of the weapons.  Iraqi forces were backed by U.S. and British reconnaissance planes as they launched their Basra offensive, an operation aimed at breaking the power of politically backed gunmen in the city.  The fiercest fighting took place in Basra neighborhoods where Iraqi forces targeted members of Sadr's Mahdi Army, further risking the collapse of a cease-fire that Sadr declared last summer. His fighters' stand-down has been widely credited with helping curb violence throughout the country during the U.S. troop buildup known as the surge.  When the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker deliver a report card on the country before Congress next month, a key gauge of progress will be whether the Iraqi government and its security forces are prepared to take over as U.S. troops withdraw.  The offensive in Basra, an important test of that preparedness, was several weeks in the making. Altough it targets the Mahdi Army in particular, its goal is also to break the grip that other Shiite militias, criminal gangs and death squads hold upon the southern port city, the conduit for Iraq's oil exports. In recent weeks, the militias have often battled one another in the streets.  It was unclear why U.S. forces would take part in a broad armed challenge to Sadr and his thousands-strong militia on the eve of Petraeus's assessment, which the Bush administration has said would greatly influence its decision on whether to draw down troop levels.  But many Sadr followers view the offensive as the latest attempt by the United States and Sadr's Shiite rivals, who run Iraq's government, to take advantage of Sadr's cease-fire to weaken his movement politically ahead of provincial elections that could take place this year.  "We are really scared," said Aahad Hamid, 27, a Basra University employee whose voice quivered on the phone as Iraqi attack helicopters flew over the city. "We can hear the voice of the bullets."  In a sign of the offensive's importance, Maliki flew to Basra on Monday to oversee operations.  By Tuesday evening, Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias had also clashed in the cities of Kut and Hilla, as well as outside Sadr's Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City. Dusk-to-dawn curfews were imposed on at least six cities in southern Iraq, police said.  In addition to resisting with arms, Sadr's movement led a labor strike for a second day in many parts of eastern and central Baghdad on Tuesday, demanding the release of Sadr's jailed followers and an end to Iraqi government raids. Sadrist leaders ordered stores to close and taxi and bus drivers to stop operations. Many neighborhoods turned into virtual ghost towns, their usually busy streets all but empty. Parents kept their children home from school.  Sadr, who imposed the cease-fire to improve his nationalist credentials and rein in his often unruly militia, is under immense pressure from senior loyalists to lift the cease-fire order. Two weeks ago, he issued a statement permitting the Mahdi Army to fire on U.S. and Iraqi forces in self-defense. Hazim al-Araji, a senior Sadr official in the southern holy city of Najaf, told reporters there that the cease-fire remains in place despite Tuesday's clashes.  Later, hundreds of Sadr followers took to the streets of Najaf, carrying Korans, Iraqi flags and olive branches. Calling Maliki "the agent of Americans," they chanted: "No, no occupation! No, no terrorism!"  "The Iraqi army went to Basra under the pretext of imposing a security plan, but the fact is they are targeting Sadrists," said Haidar al-Jaberi, a Sadr official who joined the protest.  Violence has gripped Basra since December, when British troops handed over control of the province to the Iraqi government. A power struggle between the Mahdi Army and its main rival, the Badr Organization militia of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, has battered the city in recent months. Smaller Shiite militias are also taking part in the fighting.  Ahead of the offensive, the Iraqi government closed off land access to the city and imposed a nighttime curfew until further notice. The government ordered schools, institutes and universities to cancel classes from Tuesday through Thursday. Some residents said they had no time to stock up on food and clean water.  Residents also reported that sporadic clashes began in Basra early Tuesday morning in the neighborhoods of Hayania, Jubaila and Jumhuria, all known Sadr strongholds. In telephone interviews, they described seeing military vehicles, soldiers and policemen exchanging fire with gunmen. Television footage showed militiamen firing rocket-propelled grenades at Iraqi security forces; others attacked from rooftops with AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns and mortars.  As of Tuesday afternoon, 13 gunmen, three Iraqi policemen and six civilians had been killed, police said. Scores more were injured, and at least five military vehicles were set ablaze, according to police.  "No one is on the street," said Mohammed Kadhim, who owns a clothing shop in the city center. As he spoke, gunfire could be heard in the background. "I am not able to go out of my house."  Kadhim added that one of his neighbors had been shot in the face and was in critical condition.  A total of 15,000 Iraqi military and police personnel were participating in the Basra operation, according to an adviser to Iraq's security forces who spoke by telephone. At one point in the conversation, a mortar shell landed near his building, he said. He paused to take time to check on his soldiers and examine his body for shrapnel.  "It's a tough and difficult battle," he said, adding that his men were fighting Mahdi Army militias, criminal gangs and death squads.  The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters, said he expected the campaign to take a week to 10 days. "No state can have two armies. It is either the Iraqi military or the Mahdi Army," he said.  Col. Bill Buckner, a U.S. military spokesman, said coalition forces were providing intelligence, surveillance and support aircraft. Maj. Tom Holloway, a British military spokesman, said British forces were standing by but were not involved in the crackdown. He also said the British and Americans were providing surveillance support from aircraft.  As the offensive progressed, violence broke out elsewhere in the country. In Baghdad's al-Amin neighborhood, Mahdi Army gunmen stormed two offices of the Dawa party, which Maliki heads, and clashed with guards there. Five Mahdi Army gunmen and two Dawa guards were killed, an Interior Ministry official said.  In Sadr City on Tuesday afternoon, Mahdi Army militiamen were manning checkpoints and directing traffic. The main police station was empty.  Abu Ali al-Fartousi, a Mahdi Army fighter, said a battle broke out in Sadr City at 10:30 p.m., with Mahdi fighters using machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to repel government forces. A U.S. military spokesman reported no word on any late-night fighting in Sadr City.  Lt. Col. Steven Stover, a U.S. military spokesman, said U.S. troops backed Iraqi security forces as they engaged with "special groups criminal elements outside of Sadr City." A U.S. soldier was killed about 5 p.m. in an attack near Baghdad's Adhamiyah district, the U.S. military said. He was not identified.  Special correspondents Zaid Sabah, Naseer Nouri, Dalya Hassan and K.I. Ibrahim in Baghdad, Saad Sarhan in Najaf, and Washington Post staff in Nasiriyah contributed to this report.  Source:  Washington PostI have noticed after reading some accounts from posters on these boards how much a priori reasoning has again imposed itself on the thinking of many people.  Some are equivocating who is the instigator/offender/offensive element and who is on the reactionary/defender element of this conflict.  Those who are skeptical of the surge and Iraqi progress contend that it is the Mahdi Army who is on the offensive, when in fact it is the opposite...the ISF is on the offensive to assert its control of the country.  Like it is said in the article above, there cannot be two militaries...it's either an Iraqi army or the Mahdi army.  Everyone who cares about the fate of the people in Iraq to live in a free society will put their chips and support behind the Iraqi army.  Who among the presidential candidates is most or least likely to do so?On the next episode of "As Iraq Turns..."That's very Machiavelian. Can't have another prince's army running amok in your territory.  It's purely Machiavelian...during a cease-fire no less. It's a play out of the Prince playbook.Within the next 4 months we'll all see just how meaningless the 'surge' was.All these things are great, but we are not allowed to chase them into Iran and fix the rest of the pack..  No. That's going too far. Expel them from Iraq, let someone else deal with them. All we have to do is get a secure Iraq for now. I think I under estimated the Iraqi government's... ruthless efficiency. I bet within the next 4 months we'll have almost no Mahdi Army left and Sadr will be captured/killed or "studying and praying", no politics. Remember, a few weeks ago he issued one statement saying that he wants "to drop out of politics", I think it won't take much time for us to see another similar declaration issued by him.. I just hope our guys will keep doing what they are doing now!..I think he is reaching for an epiphany of non-violent protest. I wish him God's speed on that epiphany before the fighting gets worse.

Tens of Thousands Affected In 1996, Aslin requested his files (to which he was entitled under the Public Information Act) and learned for the first time how the authorities had justified the forced sterilizations. "They termed us feeble-minded idiots, and wrote that our children would be like us or even worse," he declares. He was so infuriated at the insult that he filed suit against the state of Michigan, seeking compensation. His claim was turned down last March because the statute of limitations had expired. But Aslin intends to fight on. If a higher court accepts his appeal, the consequences could be far-reaching. For Fred Aslin and his siblings were not an isolated case.  From 1907 onward, at least 60,000 Americans were sterilized against their will. The legal basis for these forced sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. Most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and '40s, but some states, such as Virginia, continued the practice until the late 1970s. Most of the victims were poor and members of minorities, and none of them received compensation, according to Paul Lombardo, professor of law and bioethics at the University of Virginia. A Strong Eugenics Movement in the USA It is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in Germany, but in the USA as well. The doctrine, hatched in the second half of the 19th century, combined elements of social Darwinism with the Mendelian theory of heredity. Its advocates pushed for perfecting the human "gene pool" by influencing the reproductive process. Their ongoing attempts at achieving a "perfect" society included aggressive - and in the case of the Nazis, murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  American scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement, which also had its supporters in Scandinavia, Latin America and Japan. U.S. biologists like Charles B. Davenport and Harry H. Laughlin advocated keeping the "Anglo-American race" pure. Their premise was that most ailments, as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality, were hereditary in nature. Therefore persons with a "good genetic makeup" should be encouraged to have families, while "inferior" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. Among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals. Under the eugenics laws, people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as "feeble-minded" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. A Model for the Nazis By the early 1930s, some 30 American states had adopted eugenics laws. Most of them were modeled after the law which Harry H. Laughlin had drafted for the state of Virginia in 1924. That legislation found emulators outside the United States too. For example, it served Germany's National Socialists as a model for their 1933 "Law for Protection Against Genetically Defective Offspring," on the basis of which at least 400,000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. More than 200,000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the Nazis. The University of Heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist Laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his "services on behalf of racial hygiene."  In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Virginia's sterilization law. This was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the United States. American eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. In a speech to the U.S. Congress, Laughlin had argued that "morally and intellectually inferior" immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were polluting America's genetic potential. The 1924 Immigration Restriction Act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of Europe. In signing the new law, President Calvin Coolidge said: "America must remain American." Pseudo-Science at Universities For a time, the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on American society. Based largely on political and social prejudices, the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. Leading institutions, such as Harvard, Cornell and Columbia, offered courses in eugenics. Prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate J. H. Kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. So-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs, with citizens parading their "good genes." Movies like "The Black Stork" propagated eugenic sterilization.  During the 1940s, however, the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. Most American sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. In 1980, former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit, demanding compensation from the state of Virginia. But a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. That Supreme Court ruling was never fought, even in subsequent years. As a result, future damage claims have little prospect of success. And the victims of eugenic forced sterilization have no lobbying power to achieve out-of-court settlements.  Two current exhibits are attempting to shed light on this repressed chapter of American history. The Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute, is showing an exhibition of photographs and documents titled "Polluting the Pure." And the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, a genetics research institute in the state of New York, is featuring an online exhibit on the history of the American eugenics movement.* Between 1910 and 1940, the venerable Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory on Long Island housed the Eugenics Record Office, the central research facility of the American eugenics movement.

0   That doesn't surprise me. Crap! That's scary!  Tens of Thousands Affected In 1996, Aslin requested his files (to which he was entitled under the Public Information Act) and learned for the first time how the authorities had justified the forced sterilizations. "They termed us feeble-minded idiots, and wrote that our children would be like us or even worse," he declares. He was so infuriated at the insult that he filed suit against the state of Michigan, seeking compensation. His claim was turned down last March because the statute of limitations had expired. But Aslin intends to fight on. If a higher court accepts his appeal, the consequences could be far-reaching. For Fred Aslin and his siblings were not an isolated case.  From 1907 onward, at least 60,000 Americans were sterilized against their will. The legal basis for these forced sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. Most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and '40s, but some states, such as Virginia, continued the practice until the late 1970s. Most of the victims were poor and members of minorities, and none of them received compensation, according to Paul Lombardo, professor of law and bioethics at the University of Virginia. A Strong Eugenics Movement in the USA It is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in Germany, but in the USA as well. The doctrine, hatched in the second half of the 19th century, combined elements of social Darwinism with the Mendelian theory of heredity. Its advocates pushed for perfecting the human "gene pool" by influencing the reproductive process. Their ongoing attempts at achieving a "perfect" society included aggressive - and in the case of the Nazis, murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  American scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement, which also had its supporters in Scandinavia, Latin America and Japan. U.S. biologists like Charles B. Davenport and Harry H. Laughlin advocated keeping the "Anglo-American race" pure. Their premise was that most ailments, as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality, were hereditary in nature. Therefore persons with a "good genetic makeup" should be encouraged to have families, while "inferior" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. Among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals. Under the eugenics laws, people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as "feeble-minded" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. A Model for the Nazis By the early 1930s, some 30 American states had adopted eugenics laws. Most of them were modeled after the law which Harry H. Laughlin had drafted for the state of Virginia in 1924. That legislation found emulators outside the United States too. For example, it served Germany's National Socialists as a model for their 1933 "Law for Protection Against Genetically Defective Offspring," on the basis of which at least 400,000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. More than 200,000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the Nazis. The University of Heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist Laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his "services on behalf of racial hygiene."  In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Virginia's sterilization law. This was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the United States. American eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. In a speech to the U.S. Congress, Laughlin had argued that "morally and intellectually inferior" immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were polluting America's genetic potential. The 1924 Immigration Restriction Act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of Europe. In signing the new law, President Calvin Coolidge said: "America must remain American." Pseudo-Science at Universities For a time, the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on American society. Based largely on political and social prejudices, the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. Leading institutions, such as Harvard, Cornell and Columbia, offered courses in eugenics. Prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate J. H. Kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. So-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs, with citizens parading their "good genes." Movies like "The Black Stork" propagated eugenic sterilization.  During the 1940s, however, the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. Most American sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. In 1980, former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit, demanding compensation from the state of Virginia. But a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. That Supreme Court ruling was never fought, even in subsequent years. As a result, future damage claims have little prospect of success. And the victims of eugenic forced sterilization have no lobbying power to achieve out-of-court settlements.  Two current exhibits are attempting to shed light on this repressed chapter of American history. The Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute, is showing an exhibition of photographs and documents titled "Polluting the Pure." And the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, a genetics research institute in the state of New York, is featuring an online exhibit on the history of the American eugenics movement.* Between 1910 and 1940, the venerable Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory on Long Island housed the Eugenics Record Office, the central research facility of the American eugenics movement.

I don't know about your case, but it takes a LONG time to finally get all the papers in order. How about other people in here who have bought a house in the last three or so years.

0    I couldnt access your link, my computer warned of 'spy site blocking'  wtf? http://forums.myspace.com/t/3892030.aspx?fuseaction=forums.viewt hread try copy and paste...  I agree. This victim mentality is rampant. The govt. should not have to bail out the citizens who make irresponsible decisions.Me too! Its just a big scare tactic by the dems to sell their platform. Notice how they never give you the percentages of those that are in foreclosure? Thats because the last report that came out I think was at 5%!!! So 95% of people are current and paying their mortgages!I have one; and yes I was virtually "tricked" into it. The bank held off finallizing it until there wasn't time to protest the arrangements; and since I am always on the road I had to take what they offered. They also put a penalty for early payoff into it.  (I had taken time off to get it all done.) Hopefully I can get it all paid in 3 years, if the idiots in government don't screw things up even worse.  Then...apparently you also disagree with McCain's position on the mortgage crisis, which makes this a moot point.  Good luck with that, makes it hard for you to refinance doesn't it?People making the loans should take a hit in the form of defaults and bankruptcies, aka non-repayments for making bad loans, and not having decent underwriting and actuary work done. People taking the loans should lose their houses, plain and simple.  5% on current reports, which is no small number.

1 A 70-year-old Israeli woman in the southern village of Yesha has been killed by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, Israeli officials have said.  The rocket scored a direct hit on her house in the small farming community.  She is the second Israeli civilian to be killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza in less than a week.  The latest death comes as Egypt is trying to mediate a truce between Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group which controls Gaza.  The head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman, has been in Israel for talks with political leaders.  Last month the plans were given the backing of a dozen Palestinian factions including, Hamas - which has controlled Gaza since last year - and the Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas.  Israel said any truce agreement must include the release of a captured Israeli soldier and an end to arms smuggling into Gaza.  The Israeli military launches frequent air strikes or incursions into Gaza in an attempt to stop the frequent rocket fire from the territory into southern Israel.  Mortar fire from Gaza killed an Israeli man on Friday in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza. Three people were wounded.  Israeli air strikes then killed five members of Hamas.  The Gaza Strip has been controlled by Hamas since last June when they ousted their rivals from the Fatah movement.

Wow,Â I had no idea you were physic! While your at it, can you predict who is going to win the Elections, oh, and when America will pull out of Iraq?  I would just Â love to know.     McCain? You think McCain will win? I hope your wrong. I don't want to spend another 100 years in Iraq, nor do I support sombody who is buddy buddy with the lazy bum of a president we have.  To some Iraqis, we may be terrorists. But to us Americans, we are not terrorists. Its just how you view it. I don't agree with Iraq, I support pulling out, and taking care of our problems here. Besides, although our government is pretty much lazy and getting paid for doing nada, that does not mean that the rest of the country does not care. We do alot for the world, and we try to act out of morals and good hearts. I'm serious. We give aid to countries in need, we try to have a equal and fair country, we support values and good will, and we are very optimistic people. We try to be a good force in the world, even though it may not seem like it to you. I'm proud of this country and what it has done for the world, even though it has made some stupid mistakes. Such as this war. But, with all good comes the bad, and the in between. Nothing is perfect in life.  Wait, the Iraqis (most of them) want the US to leave.

Thats just what you think. And I'm sure most people could care less about wht you think when all you think is dirty words.Alright, I won't quote you anymore.  It doesn't seem like you have anything better to say other than insults anyway.  My claims? You, you Y-O-U.ÃÂ  are the one who has claimed all this stuff,  "America is "f" up. "America is a terrorist" "All America cares for is Israel and KSA" (+ all the swearing included) "Iraqis dislike Americans" ( I said some, you said who am I to judge, which can be inferred as you think all)  I'm just countering what you say. SoÃÂ whatever. I'll just leave to you spew more swear words.Quote my bullshit then.  "Enlighten Me" Israel has the right to defend herself...Wait wait...  2 Israelies... 5 Hamas militants....  where are all the dead oppressed palestinian children and women? where are those 30 to 1 rations gone to?  *cough*  that *pop* sound was my Sarcasm'o'meter blowing off the scale...   oh, and Lisa, the US is *f* up at some things... god knows, you people elected Dubyah... TWICE  i can proudly say, I never started a thread on the I/P-conflict (can't remember anyway) Lisa:  We have been in Germany and Japan for 63 years, Korea for 58.  Do you support Obama whose foreign policy advisors are like a remake of Jimmy VCarters (except for Brezinzki who was Carter's adviosr?ÃÂ  then there is Powers, Mulloy (who resigned after it became public that he had been meeting with Hamas) and retired General Merril McPeake who blames Israel for the lack of peace.  And the Arab world isn't? The real Jew-Haters think that we Jews do not have a right to defend ourselves.ÃÂ  When you ask them what actions Israel could take that they woudl approve of, they pretend that they weren't asked.ÃÂ  Except, one, who siad that israel should give back the occupied territories (which worked so well with Gaza...).

I voted for someone else (the Elders' party), won't vote for them again, and that's it.   now as for the US voting Dubyah in TWICE....   First off, both Gore and Kerry would have been better for the US and for the world. Hell, evenÃÂ  YOU would have made a better president (well, maybe not YOU but let's say... Shawn) In 20 years, Dubyah's gonna be recited in one breath with Hitler and Stalin and Mao, you dumbass... He's the worst thing that happened to the US since Vietnam  As if electing him once wasn't bad enough you actually were STUPID enough to repeat the same mistake TWICE... in a ROW...

If you want to know what is going on with the extreme left in the U.S., allow me to sendÃÂ you private messages.       To equate Bush with Hitler, Stalin and Mao is kind of nuts.  Well of course it is, but I'm saying that that other dude is blowing it wayy out of proportion. Its not like every country on earth is perfect.  I agree it would be nuts to equate Bush with either. All three were in control and were all brutal dictators. Bush is just a poor sap who's letting himself be lead along by the likes of Cheney and Rummy and their business interests. It would also be interesting to see how Bush Snr's company has done since the launch of this war on terror.Sorry, Rob History aims its darts at the man on top
1  The real Jew-Haters think that we Jews do not have a right to defend ourselves.ÃÂ  When you ask them what actions Israel could take that they woudl approve of, they pretend that they weren't asked.ÃÂ  Except, one, who siad that israel should give back the occupied territories (which worked so well with Gaza...). Ehud:  We may have elected Bush twice but at least we didn't elect Gore (whom I voted for and am glad that he lost) or Kerry (who wanted Carter and Baker to be in charge of middle-east policy).  And Olmert has what, a 3% approval rating and you can't get rid of him? He is the architect of the disaster in Lebanon, the failure to take adequate steps against the Kassams, and a whole lot of bribery.  At least Bush's ratings are higher than congresses.  Both the Republcians and Democrats suck at energy policy..ÃÂ  Since the first oil embargo in 1973, America has done NOTHING about alternate (i.e. nuclear) energy.ÃÂ  I think they have been bribed by the Saudis (who paid for clinton's and Carter's libraries and hired James Baker III as a lobbyist).  oh yeah, gore certainly would have been a worseÃÂ president than bush. lol.   LMAO  Are you joking?  First off, Olmert's got a bad approval rating but doesn't quit. what am I supposed to do about it? assassinate him? grow up you turd. I voted for someone else (the Elders' party), won't vote for them again, and that's it.   now as for the US voting Dubyah in TWICE....   First off, both Gore and Kerry would have been better for the US and for the world. Hell, evenÃÂ  YOU would have made a better president (well, maybe not YOU but let's say... Shawn) In 20 years, Dubyah's gonna be recited in one breath with Hitler and Stalin and Mao, you dumbass... He's the worst thing that happened to the US since Vietnam  As if electing him once wasn't bad enough you actually were STUPID enough to repeat the same mistake TWICE... in a ROW...  Well you didn't vote for Olmert, that's big fact #1.  Conversely, something like 49.99999999999999999% of Americans didn't vote for Bush over Kerry.  Conversely, 50.0000112145246345645746734637% of Americans didn't vote for Bush over Gore.  So the ones who didn't vote for Bush are kind of in the same boat as you, with regards to unpopular leaders. I didn't say that you voted for Olmert.ÃÂ  No, you aren't supposed to assassinate Olmert. Or Livni.ÃÂ  All I said is that he is even more unpopular than Bush and Israel can't get rid of the sleeze.ÃÂ  He has too much protexia to give away to keep the Knesset from dumping him.  I only voted for Bush the second time.ÃÂ  The first time, I voted for Gore.ÃÂ   Gore and Kerry would have been worse than Bush - worse than Clinton even.ÃÂ  That is the opinion of the american public.ÃÂ  Obama would be a worldwide disaster as well.

I really do believe the real power is with the likes of Cheney and Rumsfeld, who were both major players in the Bush snr and Reagan admins.  If another Republican gets in and those two are still in the administration we won't see a change in presidency, just a different spokesman.

0 The Brazilian Job: the follow up to Paramountâs US remake of The Italian Job is still on the cards, and itâs got a 2009 release date marked. Jason Statham, Mos Def, Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are attached, as is director F Gary Gray.  I, Robot 2: All we know on this one is that itâs in the scripting stages still, with a potential 2010 release date planned in. No news on Mr Smith's involvement.  I Am Legend 2: Warnerâs huge Christmas 2007 hit could also have a follow up, although itâd be interesting to see if Will Smith returned to it. A 2010 release date is also being mooted for this one.  Rest of the list is located below.   www.icanspeel.comShrek 5? I didn't even know there was a fourth. X-D The last I saw was Shrek the Third. How could I missed Shrek 4?a scary movie 5....why ?????  plz stop the madness, it was cool when the 1st one came out but @ 5m i thinks its time to put this franchise to rest  agreed!  i hope the silent hill sequel is superior to the first.enough with the Saw's and Scary Movie sequels. Saw's aren't scary or gross and the Scary Movies havn't been funny since the 2nd one.  Shrek 4 was announced ages ago but animated movies usually take a couple of years to make so I think it comes out next year. The films have been that successful that they don't need to wait to see if the latest film does well before announcing another sequel.  Judging by the amount of sequels planned it seems that Hollywood is playing it safe.   I think it would be difficult for Mr. Smith to be in I Am Legend 2.  Yep, they should have went with the alternate ending if they wanted him for a sequel.This is going to be very interesting!!  Silent Hill in my opinion was all I expected in a movie.. i have never played the games, but knew alot about the story...wonder where they are going to take this sequel!  Ace Ventura 3: oh please no!!!  The People Under The Stairs 2: wonder what made them after all these years to finally make a part 2.  The Untouchables: looking forward to this one!  Thought I heard a couple of years ago about Ghostship 2 being in post production? guess i heard wrong!every one of them a waste of film...maybe The Untouchables prequel about the rise of Capone will be good...

0 If someone dies after there lead to believe they were healed and then nolonger want to a doctor for treatment then later died. Should the faith healer be held accountable?How about if its a child should the healer be charged or a the parents?no. and no.all of the above, charge them allnah. gotta give natural selection a chance.Under many states' laws they already are accountable. At least in the second case. what if ur a well know healer like Benny Hinn where he works world wide and people have dead and yet he still is able to preach.I say aleast been them from preaching in this country.  while at one time im sure i would have wholeheartedly agreed, the entire point, the gift if you would of being human, an opposible thumb aside, is the capacity to through intellect and foresight free ourselves from the brutal bondage and base nature of the darwinist design weve clung to for so long as unwaivering truth, as though we as a species who have already overcome so much and already disproven so many preconcieved truths were for some reason incapable of doing so...  it is our duty to help the "stupid"lol....for we were once "stupid" too  okay, darwin didn't work. how about taking responsibility for your own actions and dumbass decisions? (i'm torn on the child issue...)well it is a whole cult issue, but it is the person's choice to not want medical treatment, unless they were brainwashed by set cult or person, but it really depends on the situation before one can really judge if it's right or wrong I dont think u can call fellowers of Benny Hinn a cult, u has milliond of believers in america alot.How many cult leaders are on cable tv like he is.

People die in hospitals all the time. If your beliefs are not main stream its your choice. Nobody has the right to force an adult into any treatment. Minors are a different story but even then they should have control of choice before 18. We had a kid with some type of cancer here who refused traditional care and his parentsd supported him. I think he was around 16 at the time the court battles started. After a few court battles he won his case and is still alive. It could have killed him but he had the right, its his body. Dont even try to tell I have to follow traditional medical procedures. My body, my choice.

Wrong forum  the federal or states right to interced in the improper administration of healthcare isnt political?Religious forumi say both the topic was about should or could crimanial charges be place aganist a faith healer who is also a pastor.Just becauae ur a pastors doesnt mean u can con the people and get away with it. if a faith healer is a pastor of a mega church like Benny Hinm or there some street corner con artist healer should they be treated any different. No. Its personal choice. Your health unless it effects society (as in something highly contagious) is a personal decision. It doesnt matter if you base your chgoice on a fortune cookie. Its your life.

No, no, no...that's not how these tele-evangelists get 100 million bones in the bank and still have the nerve to ask for donations for $36 million Gulfstream jets that cost $6000/month to maintain.  It's the stupid message of "Give a bunch of money to my ministry and you will be just as rich in return!"  The church I used to go to, which to me was quite unlistenable as the pastor's only message was about he got shot and he's now prosperous as the congregation helped him put a huge downpyment on a Lexus, was nothing but a pit stop for donations.  This was Jesse Duplantis--in trouble with eyeballers of ministry finances all over--message EVERY TIME I begrudgingly saw him.ÃÂ   "Everyone...stand up!"  "If you are debt-free....sit down!"  "Everyone else that's standing...if you want to be rich and prosper...BUY MY BOOKS!"ÃÂ  (WTF???)  After that, it was a bunch of stupid jokes that I'd heard before.  I never had the money to give and I never got the "you're blessed by what you give" mantra, because that's just wrong quite frankly, but at least my parents stopped this donation crap once I let them in on the ponzi scheme run by many of these big shots.  Benny Hinn's skank daughter gets a senior summer trip from donations...that was their sign to stop.  It's people's greed on both sides, that's all there is to that.

Hope they don't get caught with their guard down again this time.  Washington DC may vaporize along with every major city we, our allies, and even possible allies have.  But if there is someone safe in a bunker...with a itchy trigger finger and knowledge on exactly WHO to repay for the free fireworks.  Although perhaps, they may have planned in advance for that possiblity and took the nessesary precautions to defend against such a threat.  It hard to defend yourself, when you KNOW exactly what to expect right?  I truly hope my source is whacked.  you are completely out of your tree.

The credits are the highlight of the film.  Oh right, was that why it became the most acclaimed film of all time? Actually Citizen Kane is a brilliant film, it was highly influential, it was a landmark in filmmaking, it practically changed the way films are made, Orson Welles created a certain cinematography in the film that is revolutionary  Right here. Awesome ending.    Also, Se7en. Little Known Fact: Orson Welles is in the Guiness Book Of World Records for eating more pork chops than any human being ever in one sitting. Look it up.Hm...I don't really pay attention to which endings I like best, but I must say I like the ending to the movie Wanted. I saw it yesterday. Actually, the whole movie was pretty good. IT was kind of confusing at time sbecause of the flashbacks and all, but I'd say it's better than a lot of the films that has been ocming out lately.
0 Just finished watching it. Ok, I was wrong, Last House on the Left does not feature the most vile rape scene ever put on film. Whoa. But hey, at least the victim is not stabbed to death then disemboweled or forced to pee on herself. The I Spit rapists are real humanitarians. The movie itself was not as bad as I remembered it. In fact, while I guess it's really impossible to say you liked or enjoyed a film like this, I must say this is a decent film. The acting was good, and the story was ok. The DVD edition I rented cleaned up the picture beautifully. There's no way I saw a version as pristine as this when I saw it at the drive-in or on vhs 20+ years ago. All the dvd extras were great. Original reviews were available including two I remember very well, from Siskel(RIP) and my man Ebert, that caused it to be removed from the old United Theater here in Chicago. The director of the film gives an interesting commentary and tells about an actual event in his own life that he says inspired him to tell the story. I'd actually have to go against the guys and give this film a marginal thumbs up. The dvd as a package is very good and kudos to the director for not doing a musical score.hehe..I love your review of I Spit on your Grave Mark.JANE FONDA'S NEW WORKOUT VIDEO!One of the best shocker film IMO  This film is disturbingly spectacular and one of the best revenge film ever.  Kill Bill eat your heart out :)   Was it the uncut version why they shove the broken bottle in her erm erm you know what during the rape scene? Ouch that scene was gruesome....This film is technically a lesson to men...

But trust me this film will make you look at women in a different light lol.   Another few great recommendations for horror from the 1980s  The Burning Silent Night, Deadly Night  I'm Downloading them currentlynice i have a dvd planet by my house and they have a bunch of these old cult type horror joints im see if i can find it there...cuz im not sure my video store will have this one...Meh  Netflix will definately have them   Or just download Utorrent and find the films via torrent and watch them on the good old compy or put them on DVD :)   That's what i'm gonna do with the one i'm Downloading, because i cant find them over here and plus side one of them ain't even on DVD release, which is Silent Night Deadly Night 3.

As I reflect back on it, I did find it somewhat disturbing that she allowed the mentally challenged dude to have sex with her before killing him. Did she feel sorry for him and did not want him to die a virgin? I get getting naked with the lead dude to castrate him in the tub, but the hanging thing didn't really make sense. I thought she did it to make it look like a suicide at first, but nope.

We had the Star-Lite Drive In for many years here but back in the late 1980s it was shut down and converted to a swap meet, which is still is to this day. The giant movie screen is still up and everything though.

He felt she liked it and was coming back for seconds, or would that be fourths or fifths? She convinced him when she shot at him one minute, then relinquished the gun. Like I said, he's a freakin' idiot. Who the fuck would even do that to another person in the first place?  This was the uncut version I believe, and I got it from Netflix.  Glad I could entertain you Heidi, I'm a regular Roger Ebert! lol  But seriously, where are all the black movie reviewers? Roger is an honorary brother, but I think I'm going to send in an application.  Are there any drive-ins left in America?There is one in NJ that I know of and I think there is still one in PA and CA. Not sure about anywhere else. I love drive ins? Loved this movie, revenge is a bitch. I saw it years ago and this was the first film I saw where a woman just fucked her attackers up. Loved that!!! Glad you watched it again. I told you :)You were correct miss lady! As I reflect back on it, I did find it somewhat disturbing that she allowed the mentally challenged dude to have sex with her before killing him. Did she feel sorry for him and did not want him to die a virgin? I get getting naked with the lead dude to castrate him in the tub, but the hanging thing didn't really make sense. I thought she did it to make it look like a suicide at first, but nope.  We have on in Sac thats been open 20+ years. Its closing after summer :(  Werent all the killings done in a sexual way? I think thats what makes the movie more unique and twisted.Another one bites the dust huh. Too bad. Going to the drive in as a kid was such fun. Glad to hear there is still one in NJ. And the last two murders weren't sexual really. She didn't have to get naked at all! And I am torn, should I have been happy or sad that she didn;t get naked.  Yeah I didnt see the last murders. I know they were done on a boat but I didnt see how she did them.Didn't I read somewhere that they are currently remaking this film?  We had the Star-Lite Drive In for many years here but back in the late 1980s it was shut down and converted to a swap meet, which is still is to this day. The giant movie screen is still up and everything though.Also wanted to add that, while I Spit on your Grave probably does have the most disturbingly graphic rape depictions, does anyone else remember Mother's Day? A bizarre 1980s, direct-to-video(I think) slasher that had the family of backwoods retards who kidnap and rape a group of female campers(the men do while their crazy old mom watches and laughs) and, like I Spit..., features a few of the surviving girls getting revenge on the hicks(one notable scene involved someone downing some Draino) towards the end but the whole thing was disturbing as Hell to me back then. I have not seen it since then though so it maybe just a cheese-fest I do not remember well.  Also Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has a scene or two that put me off of horror flicks for a while.

We do have a movie in the park night(Grant Park) downtown that's free. They show classics like All About Eve, North By Northwest to keep all the crazy teens and gangbangers away. All on a huge screen with great sound. You bring your picnic stuff or just a blanket and chill.  I think I did see that Mother's day. I can't remember what it was about though.
0 I've been talking to someone for about 2 years now on and off. And before we started talking again he got cheated on by his previous gf...so, at first he would never stop talking about her..and I kinda got pissed off...But now, I went on his myspace an dhe has a music video of a song "missin' you"...and I know sure as hell know it isn't about me. So he tells me now that his "friend" posted it up...so should I believe what I saw..or give him the benefit of the doubt?I guess there aren't any Dr.Phil's up in hurr. lmao x]it's definately dedicated to his ex and i'm sure he did posted.it's obvious that he's not ready for a new gf yet,so give him that time cuz all he needs right now is a good friend until he's ready to open his heart to someone else again.  i hope i answered your question...Thanks(:  i think every one desrves a chance. but if you think he still has feelings for tihs other girl than it wont work out. trust me. i know i speak jibberish most of the time lol. but ive been through alot and i have been through that whole thing before. if your getting stessed over if he still has feelings for this girl it will make it harder on your relationship. you said you guys have been together for 2 years on and off. but thats not really that long. your still young and can find plentry of others, who you CAN trust and know for a fact that your the only one they care about. i hope this helps and makes sense lol.This  Lol, it does.. I'm surprised you didn't say..  "Pfft, drop that zero and get with a hero...') *cheesy smile with yur thumbs up*"  lmao jkwell what i meant to say is.....if i could rearange the ABC's i would put U and I together...lol jus playin.LMAO.

0 When your bored on campus what really gets your mood going in the right direction? Is it good old fashioned reefer, or is it the liquer that fucks you up quicker?for me its not what fucks me up quicker, its what is safer. of course weed. when you drink too much you cant drive, plus barfing is not fun when you have had to much to drink.yea but its not like weed is all that safe, you don't even know whats in the bag your buying cuz its not regulated...*shrugs shoulders* i'm bout 2 go roll a fattyyah and i bet you a regular, so really you know. its like we i get my shit i go in some dark alley, scared of being mugged. you know.....its nothing like that  Man, weed will put your ass in jail!!! Drink in moderation, don't drive and enjoy.  I agree. Alcohol is legal and therefore more fun, because there's no chance of getting busted and catching a posession charge. Besides, liquor's cheaper and lasts longer :) any thing less than an once is a peddy misdemeanor. no jail timeweed can be free. its called growing it. dose you're alcohol grow. no.both together(droned)

0 I like both, but personally like liquor more.  I've actually had a friend constantly down my throat with "No, weed is the way to go!!! You'll feel so much better and less angry!!! Alcohol drinkers are always mad and no fun!!" and it's honestly making me hate the idea of smoking more and more.    still, you fags dont know that sexual expression beats that shit any time  not that im a perv, its just that,  sexuality is natural. your brain has instincts relating to it. if youre going to do something "bad", do something that nature intends.weeeeed. always wins.pot is grown in nature, and saying nature didn't intend for us to smoke pot, is like saying God made a mistake when he created it. agree? same goes for mushrooms and opium. not that ive ever done any of itWell weed makes you feel good, and not like puking. Alcohol makes you wanna vomit, and makes u feel that way the next morning.   I think you know which one is winWell humm. Ive done my fair share of both in my time. Alchohol, you drink you it, you wait, you get drunk, you keep drinking till you puke and pass out. bam, call it a night. fun night tho right?  Weed, you smoke..you smoke...and if ur a bitch, you pass out real early, cuz you cant handle da dro. BUt sum people. jsut keep smoking and smoking till everything gone and everyones blowed. fun again right?  Then theres both at the same time. which usually leads to blackouts, puking, sex with people you dont know. waking up with no recollection of how you got there. this is fun to, more for memories than action.  My answer to the question tho. Weed, straight up. wanna burn one?both. 3 shots and a joint will have me set. Though if i had to choose one, then weed by a mile. Didn't know mister t posted here I pity da foo dat crosses him I pity da fooyou are too small to use weed! arent u? ;)

0 Silent Hill was a great moviewow...I was going to post that same exact clip...errrr...ok... I kid, Duncan...  I know my comment was directed to the OP.Pyramid Head was the only thing passable in that shit fest.god that movie is one of my top ten fav movies and my fav movie that i would consider being a horror flick.Ouch!that movie was terrible. just play the game.
0 anybody bother by the fact mccain is "learning to get online" that is even a few steps down from bushes "one of the things i've used on the google is to pull up maps"  not that i'm some big obama fan but isn't it time we have a president that is at least mildly computer literate?They got people for that. well "they" have "people" for everything...so why even care who gets elected? lets just vote in a retarded paraplegic cat. or to quote Burroughs, "A$$hole doesn't know what buttons to push or what happens when you push them" seriously here we have a guy who can pass laws to that effect the internet and doesn't even know how to get on it and i'm willing to bet he can't find the power button on his computer either, but we got people for that. i would just like to think that who ever gets elected is a bit worldly, a renaissance man or woman if you will and so living in our tech driven world understand something about it. its not like i'm asking for the president to be some macrovision drm breaker, just to at LEAST know how to get online.Hahahaha. This thread is funny.  Indeed they do. You're never seen a puter in the Oval Office.  But you'd have to expect that anyone who is the least bit curious about anything, and wants to see what's really out there besides what is digested by staff, would have a desktop in the private office off the Oval.Â  AlsoÂ a desktop for notes, e-mail, and writing, especially while in transit.  You would expect that with IT so critical to the economy and national security, the Commander-In-Chief would have at least a nodding acquaintance with hacks, viruses, broadband, and such.  He should also know that CERT is not a breath mint.  If there is a generation gap between the majority of the people and Senator McCain, this is another tellingÂ example.  And if this is just a continuation of the incuriosity, inattention, and vincible ignorance of the current president, so much the worse.  "What color is the red phone?" -- George W. BushAnother reason why a Rock would make a better president than McLame.Thats crazy talk Iam sure Mccaine knows how to run basic programs and the internet,You younger people in your twentys that grew up on computers have a hard time beleaving that some people as old as Mccaine probably dont really have a want or need for computers.I know his daughter is the one who runs his election site. I have met alot young of people that dont like PCs and really have a desire to use them. If an executive of a major corperation asks for a document or information, do you really think hes going to sit down at a PC and get it himself? or make one of the people they pay to do it?.  Have you ever been in a CEO's office? Or a VP's office?  Why not visit one soon? when the information is on a shared drive or within grasp of their computer for them to get? well ever executive i have known has done so. when it is down the hall being typed by his secretary on a royal typewriter, than no, they do usually send for it...or they send an *gasp* and email asking if someone could email them back the documentÂ·which in mccains case he would have to get his wife to come in and help him with  Wow. A blast from the past. I remember typewriters.  For skool I had a Smith-Corona and then an Olympia portable, plus one of the first Selectrics, ensconced in student publications offices.Â  The skool paper set its type every night on Justowriters, which were almost as noisy as pavement breakers.  In my first job I had a Remington manual, then an Olympia manual with moreÂ enameled sheet steel than a small fridge.  In the next job, everyone had IBM Selectrics.  ThenÂ down the chain to an IBM Executive, with type bars.  The next shop had correcting Selectrics, until the owner bought me a DECmate for Christmas.  Then secretaries became an endangered species.  And middle-aged, highly placed people had to learn how to type.  My heart bled for them.

And if this is just a continuation of the incuriosity, inattention, and vincible ignorance of the current president, so much the worse.  "What color is the red phone?" -- George W. BushAnother reason why a Rock would make a better president than McLame.Thats crazy talk Iam sure Mccaine knows how to run basic programs and the internet,You younger people in your twentys that grew up on computers have a hard time beleaving that some people as old as Mccaine probably dont really have a want or need for computers.I know his daughter is the one who runs his election site. I have met alot young of people that dont like PCs and really have a desire to use them. If an executive of a major corperation asks for a document or information, do you really think hes going to sit down at a PC and get it himself? or make one of the people they pay to do it?.  Have you ever been in a CEO's office? Or a VP's office?  Why not visit one soon? when the information is on a shared drive or within grasp of their computer for them to get? well ever executive i have known has done so. when it is down the hall being typed by his secretary on a royal typewriter, than no, they do usually send for it...or they send an *gasp* and email asking if someone could email them back the documentÂ·which in mccains case he would have to get his wife to come in and help him with  Wow. A blast from the past. I remember typewriters.  For skool I had a Smith-Corona and then an Olympia portable, plus one of the first Selectrics, ensconced in student publications offices.Â  The skool paper set its type every night on Justowriters, which were almost as noisy as pavement breakers.  In my first job I had a Remington manual, then an Olympia manual with moreÂ enameled sheet steel than a small fridge.  In the next job, everyone had IBM Selectrics.  ThenÂ down the chain to an IBM Executive, with type bars.  The next shop had correcting Selectrics, until the owner bought me a DECmate for Christmas.  Then secretaries became an endangered species.  And middle-aged, highly placed people had to learn how to type.  My heart bled for them.  Where I work I get a ton of old people that wont use the "Self Check" at the damn Grocery because they think its stupid and to hard to learn. When all you do is press a button and the machine tells you what to do next.  An executive of a large Copration wouldnt have their job if they didnt know how to use a computer unless they own a lot of stock in the company.
0 I hope he gets a Myspace account so I can call him a fag. the Bilderbergs LOL you know that list on wikipedia isn't correct. that isn't really where we hold our meetings.Ok here is the summary: Obama is the beginning of the end. McCain will just do as Bush is. Either way we are screwed. I mean Obama said he will visit all 57 states. (Muslim States) And McCain is senile and will probably die in a year. It says that you are a 104 year old female, What I mean is I graduated in the early 80s and it was a short time after that, PCs were introduced into my school most people my age either learned about computers because of there job or they learned because they wanted to on there own. For me it was a little of both. I cant imagine why a person wouldnt want to learn how to use a PC in this day and age but apparently Mccain chose not to.Mccain has been a senator for many years and his lack of computer skills has not hampered his elections to this point and I dont think it will hamper his presidentual bid. The issues are more important than whether he know how to operate a PC. But I do understand what you are saying. Maybe they refuse to use it, I wont use it simply because if there is a live human that probably needs a job one Isle down, I will go to them. If corporations had there way there wouldnt be anyone at the checkouts. So every time you use the self checkout you are sending a message arnt you.Do you get a discount on your goods when you use the self checkout? I would say OBAMMMAhmmm....a president who isnt going to be using google or wikipedia in office, what a shame  computer skills may be a necessary skill in many other important jobs, but i dont really see it being essential for the presidentIts not... they want to attack Mccaine any way they can, but I do wonder why he never learned just for fun, I love my PC unless it crashes for no reason whatsoever!  Ya know, all things considered, being the president of the US ain't no big deal. mind telling me one thing that the somone on a computer could do that the president(not directly using a computer) wouldnt be able to do?

0 I was watching The Faculty the other day..a movie that I've seen MANY times.Yet for the first time I realized it was Directed by Robert Rodriguez...WOW...how dumb did I feel. I love his movies and all this time This was one of his....hahaha.  You probably didn't notice. . . due to the predominantly white cast LOL!   hahaha..that's true...  and after I realized he directed it it finally occurred to me what Salma Hayak was doing in that cast because as of that point it was random that she was in it.hes made two movies that can be considered watchable. the rest of his career he has spent sucking tarantino's cock.   and what movies are those? I count 3 El Mariachi From Dusk till Dawn The Faculty   what about  Desperado Sin City Planet Terror Spy Kids(hahah j/k)  Desperado is the Americanized version of El Mariachi. Sin City was good but not all him though. Desperado was ok, but the Red Ninja is right it's just american El Mariachi spy kids lol  true..but ehy are good movies....  I do agree with you on the Tarantino bit though.  He needs to pan out by himself!

I remember seeing an interview withMiller saying that he didn't direct a shot, but was there for advice for a lot of the filming, so Rodriguez insisted that he take a co-director credit. I'm sure he helped make it great, but that movie in and of itself was all Rodriguez. That said, I'd agree to all the movies listed so far as being worth watching. In your post and the other with a list. I'd throw in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, but mainly only for Depp's performance.

In your post and the other with a list. I'd throw in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, but mainly only for Depp's performance. i'll let you guys figure that out   No mames guey!!!  He's only seen two of his movies . . . learn to read between the lines Miss Sin.   Do you really think Im that stupid..?   I still believe that although they are very similar....they are great in their own ways.  hahaha...yeah Americanized in Mexico!!!! puras pinche Puta Mathres!!!!I had no ideal he directed the Faculty, I like most of his movies.  Maybe I'll rent it since it's been so long since I've watched it. I'm not saying that Sin City is bad, but if Rodriguez didn't take full credit then I'm not giving him full credit.
0  Sin City was good but not all him though. Desperado was ok, but the Red Ninja is right it's just american El Mariachi spy kids lol  true..but ehy are good movies....  I do agree with you on the Tarantino bit though.  He needs to pan out by himself!What do you mean Sin City wasn't all his?

0 Do you think it is just a nasty rumour made up by man haters,or a genuine truth? Do you agree that men have run their course?  Thoughts please,everybody!!!Most boys/men I know seem to think that women are inherently inferior...I think men and women are mostly equal, but woman usually don't have as much power as men because of three things:   1: Woman are more likely to have less time to gain rank, they spend more time on education, family, etc. and they spend more money, money = time lost.  2: Woman are less likely to use force in order to get what they want.  3: Woman care about other peoples' feelings too much, they are less likely to get rid of people who are in their way.  Basically the percentage of woman who "play nice" is higher than the percentage of men who do. Also they focus on education more than men. (the education system actually tends to hold people back in life --- it's hard to prove due to the fact that the corporations think otherwise, without corp./gov. backing it would be obvious though.)I don't believe that women and men are equal, it is something women are still trying to strive towards this very day.  I don't think it is a matter of time, education or "playing nice" but rather lack of experience and setting a higher bar for oneself (demand more). Women need to be more demanding and stand up for what they believe in. There is nothing wrong with having your voice heard or making a man serve you.  In ancient times it was a common thing to have men for slaves, ones that worshipped their goddess. By demanding more from men and holding that power that we truly have but have lost over time (threw greedy white men) it is a matter of regaining and utilizing what we have inside of us.  Being in control doesn't always have to be associated with bdsm or even being a control freak. Control, domination and power can come in many levels. It is a matter of what you want out of your own life and using what you are comfortable with.  All in all, be yourself!According to most sitcoms that I watch... Yes. We are entering a world dominated by women. Or are as my nerdy half cousin would call it: "We are about to interface with theÂ orifice of a matriarchtical society, flamen!"all of this shit is funny.Personally? I think everything is based on personal merit.  I've come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist, but I have never failed to get what I wanted because I never let them regard me in a lower way. I think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence, you can get most things done.  This is probably because I grew up training horses with guys though. You can whine, bitch, and moan.  I think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way... which can work to an extent, but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future. More likely a pat on the head and a send her on her way. soooo how the hell does that put other women at a disadvantage?LOL..don't even answer.   Haha, I will answer.  Because, if some chick screws her boss to get a raise, how much respect is there in that? She's basically a whore.  That's an extreme example, but generally the meaning is the same. I don't respect girls who use their looks to get what they want in the work place. Key Phrase:"She's basically a whore."  ...

I don't respect girls who use their looks to get what they want in the work place. Key Phrase:"She's basically a whore."  ...That's what I'm saying. There's no respect in that relationship. So how can they be equal?This thread just made my morning. :) finally , a sharp minded teen.
0 According to most sitcoms that I watch... Yes. We are entering a world dominated by women. Or are as my nerdy half cousin would call it: "We are about to interface with theÂ orifice of a matriarchtical society, flamen!"all of this shit is funny.Personally? I think everything is based on personal merit.  I've come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist, but I have never failed to get what I wanted because I never let them regard me in a lower way. I think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence, you can get most things done.  This is probably because I grew up training horses with guys though. You can whine, bitch, and moan.  I think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way... which can work to an extent, but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future. More likely a pat on the head and a send her on her way. soooo how the hell does that put other women at a disadvantage?LOL..don't even answer.   Haha, I will answer.

So how can they be equal?This thread just made my morning. :) finally , a sharp minded teen.Women have made great strides here in the past few decades, thanks in part to the feminist movement. Women have more opportunities available to them now than they've ever had. (At least in recorded history). They are now able compete in more sports than ever before and they now have equal access to colleges and schools and to most careers. And now with equal access women are showing that they can hang and even outshine the boys. More women than men are going to college and more are graduating and starting new careers. On some campuses almost 70% of the student population is female. Women are taking on more leadership responsibilites and some tests show that women in general make better managers or leaders. Women in their twenties in most large cities in the US are actually making more money than the men in their own age group. A lot of successful women are finding it hard to find a man who makes what they make. More and more, women are actually making more than their husband of boyfriend. I do believe society has become more feminized. Just look at the news with the war in Iraq. Ever since Vietnam, people have begun to question war and the need for it. Women historically have never been in favor of war and most men are becomming that way. I believe Women are definately making a huge mark on history at this very moment and I do believe we will see more of a female influence on leadership, politics, education, etc. etc. etc. where before they never had a voice.

1 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7527873.stm  And did you have a comment to go with this one Maxwell? By the way, i'm still eagerly anticipating your response to my reply about those "perversions" you were talking about in that other thread when you get a moment.  P.S. You wouldn't happen to be one of those evangelicals would you? Your posts always seem to have a similar air about them as an evangelical on a moral crusade. Anything wrong with being evangelical in belief? The "gay lifestyle" is not for everyone!!  I asked a question if you had any comment about this article, along with a brief nudge to point you to that other thread where you were speaking of gays as "abnormal" and "perverted".  Obviously you have no real comment to make on this topic, or do you? Did you want to talk about the evils of drinking perhaps? Or maybe you wanted to say how evil technology is? Who knows, perhaps you can enlighten us with your gospel? Thank God these two "drunken wenches" were stopped from opening the plane door at 30,000 feet! Passengers who fly should watch their intake of alcohol and other spirits. Man, what was going through their "alcohol soaked" minds?"  Another question, and perhaps quite an important one is what was going through the minds of those who allowed these on the plane? Usually there's a sign at the check in saying that they have the right to refuse passage to anyone appearing drunk, etc.. But you're always going to get things like this happening.  And what we don't know either is how much the cabin crew took from them for any in flight drinks? I know that they're not usually too fussy when it comes to selling drinks on flights, they probably make a bit of commission off them, so safety is a secondary issue.When these two "lushes" started to "act up" why weren't they cut off? Any other drinking establishment would have done that!  Who knows. Like I said, you're not going to stop these kinds of things. I do think there are more important things in the world to worry about though than incidents like this.A bunch of "out of control "wenches", a sudden decompression" of an aircraft. That not important?  Maxwell, I said there are MORE IMPORTANT things in the world to worry about.  By the way, still no response on that other thread, what happened?  Stuck for words?

0 This classic of restrained horror, directed by Albert Lewin and starring Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, and Donna Reed will be released on DVD for the very first time in October. Anyone else a fan of this film?I've never actually seen it but I'm a huge fan of Oscar Wilde. I might have to get hold of a copy next month.I read the book.how is it?the book?I believe there's a new movie in the works.Book was kinda boring.  Interesting.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235124/I love the 1945 film. Hurd Hatfield made a good Dorian Gray, but George Sanders stole the show as Lord Wotton. And the paintings (by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright) were excellent.

Interesting.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235124/I love the 1945 film. Hurd Hatfield made a good Dorian Gray, but George Sanders stole the show as Lord Wotton. And the paintings (by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright) were excellent.
1 This classic of restrained horror, directed by Albert Lewin and starring Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, and Donna Reed will be released on DVD for the very first time in October.

1 Some people are jealous of those that are more successful than them and want to take their money.  I can defeat any Liberal in a debate.  I was graduating High School when you where born.   Oh? and did you take the short bus gil? Newsflash. This, is not a debate. I gave two examples. I am sure there are people out there who are jealous of those that are more successful than myself and want to take their money.  However. I am not one of them. I am happy for people who have earned what they have but only on the condition that they attained it honestly. I think that anyone who attains anything they desire, not just money, by illegal, cruel, selfish and greedy behavior should be looked down upon. Hmm, give everybody health care and strengthen the lower class? So, I have to pay for all of the lazy ass people out there that don't want to get a job and give more hand outs to the lower class...I say hell no. But, you probably think to tax the rich is a good plan. As for the hunting...when was the last time you ate at McDonald or was that hair dye animal tested?  You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care. oh yeah but she is just lazy as all hell. unfortunately there are hundreds of thousands of lazy people like that in america I guess, by your logic. Those lazy mother fuckers need a couple more jobs and maybe sell their ass on the street huh?  With the price of tax going up it would pay for YOUR health care. YOU are not paying for anyone else. add it up dumb ass. My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.  Yes taking the insanely rich More than the poor is a good thing. McCain WANTS to tax the POOR more and give tax cuts to the rich. When I say insanely rich I do not mean like 60 k a year. I mean million..billion and trillionairs.  and no sorry. i do not eat fast food. and i use all organic, non-animal tested products. sorry to crush your hopes and dreams.This ideo is no longer availableMeg.: You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care.   Meg is either lying or heartless.

Meg.:  i do not eat fast food. and i use all organic, non-animal tested products.   I understand now. Bless her heart.first off i was sorta making a joke but i see it failed with ur liberal views. i actually love to watch his show takes me away fromt he stupidity of polictics and makes me laugh again.  oh and i four i wasnt pissing in my pants sorry you grew up that way. and not all conservatives are full a rage i find it fun to debate with Respecftul and educated democrates. but what i do get pissed at i will say is how no one has yet to ask obama the real questions. for example, MSNBC, The View and ophrah have all had obama one thier shows or network and have treated him like a god, and someone who has ben in washington for a long time and knows the answer to everything but yet didnt ask him anything. all the shows we have seen except for ophrah have had mccain on them and have "tried" to attack him but have failed.  if you dont believe me just watch barbra walters on the view who kept trying to attack mccain and make him look bad just cuz he didnt know how many house's he owns which really are all owned by his wifes company. but all they could ask obama was about the rumour of him being related to brad pitt. WOW cuz its so important to know about that.  I say 1 time put both in a room with normal people to ask questions and lets see what happens.  thats all i really mad at everything else is fun to watch, hell even snl got a laugh out of me on the palin look a like.social heathcare will fail in this country it hasnt worked anywhere else it wont work here.  i belive we need to make healthcare a little cheaper to a certain degree. we shouldnt just give it away like to do food stamps. the more u give stuff away like that the higher prices go up so you still cant get it. its like when he said if u just tax the corps. they just go up on prices what we need to do is not tax anyone more but to stop all the loop holes in the system. you can raise the tax all you want on the rich they will just find a way out of it.  oh and on you stupid comment about 250K being rich yeah like 30 years ago. my Father makes 140k alone that doesnt include all th bonouses he gets through out the year and the investments he has made and yet he is still struggling a little not alot but he odesnt have a maid or personal driver in fact he dives a 1997 dondge intrepid that needs new brakes and belts. yes he does things with my mom time to time but they work thier ass off to save money for trips. we went from being in a trailer trach area to living in a nicer town. its not 90210 but its safer and better then what we had before and its cuz he worked his ass off and still does.  Sure thier are those who do work hard that need help but thier are just as many in the lower class that dont do anything that expect the govermnt to take care of them and its bull. go watch and see people get food stamps and watch the poeple who pull up in escallades with 22's go get some. its bull so whats going to happen is now my dad and mom are going to have to pay more taxes of rthem to get more free stuff from the gov.

I say 1 time put both in a room with normal people to ask questions and lets see what happens.  thats all i really mad at everything else is fun to watch, hell even snl got a laugh out of me on the palin look a like.social heathcare will fail in this country it hasnt worked anywhere else it wont work here.  i belive we need to make healthcare a little cheaper to a certain degree. we shouldnt just give it away like to do food stamps. the more u give stuff away like that the higher prices go up so you still cant get it. its like when he said if u just tax the corps. they just go up on prices what we need to do is not tax anyone more but to stop all the loop holes in the system. you can raise the tax all you want on the rich they will just find a way out of it.  oh and on you stupid comment about 250K being rich yeah like 30 years ago. my Father makes 140k alone that doesnt include all th bonouses he gets through out the year and the investments he has made and yet he is still struggling a little not alot but he odesnt have a maid or personal driver in fact he dives a 1997 dondge intrepid that needs new brakes and belts. yes he does things with my mom time to time but they work thier ass off to save money for trips. we went from being in a trailer trach area to living in a nicer town. its not 90210 but its safer and better then what we had before and its cuz he worked his ass off and still does.  Sure thier are those who do work hard that need help but thier are just as many in the lower class that dont do anything that expect the govermnt to take care of them and its bull. go watch and see people get food stamps and watch the poeple who pull up in escallades with 22's go get some. its bull so whats going to happen is now my dad and mom are going to have to pay more taxes of rthem to get more free stuff from the gov.140k is not 250k  it is 110k less.My uncles make about 250k a year, and the only expensive car they own, is a VW Golf. No butlers, hookers, personal servants, maids, yaddayaddayadda. 28,ooo and barely surviving? Pfft. That's a fine income, now add your husbands into that. Now, if that is both of your incomes combined, you are still well off, just don't have any kids anytime soon. Maybe 28,000 isn't that much in your area? No animal testing products are everywhere, even at your local wally world. We're not all lazy and jobless, we're just fucking poor.  Trillionaires? Name one. Just one.  And that was the most brilliant thing said in the entire post.
1 This ideo is no longer availableMeg.: You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care.   Meg is either lying or heartless.  Meg.: My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Bless her heart. She thinks doctors, dentists, and psychiatrists work for free.   Meg.: Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.   I wonder why she think this...

0 So why is Lady DeRotshchild so concered about the dems losing the election if her nephew Philip is pushing McCain? Is there a split between her husband Evelyn Rothschild and his brother Jacob, whose son hosted a fundraiser for John McCain?if u have billions of dollars, u buy both candidates --what's a couple million when u have billions (thousands of millions)  the Rothschild family has allegedly been highly involved on both ends of the political spectrum for hundreds of years and have even allegedly been involved in coercion of markets through media and black-ops along with JP Morgan interests and the Rockefellers.  Those are three families that the fringe conspiracy research community have addressed for decades.

This book by Dr. John Coleman, author of The Committee of 300, tells how Mayer Amschel, the founder of the âRed Shieldâ dynasty, acquired his first fortune. It is a far cry from the myths and legends that still surround the man who began as a rag and bone merchant and pawnbroker, working out of a small house on Judenstrasse, Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, where he lived with his wife and family. The events attributed to history are often caused by a âhidden handâ pulling the strings of kings, emperors, princes and potentates from behind the scenes. This phenomenon is explained, and the legends that have grown up around the Rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the Rothschildâs intriguing that brought down men like Napoleon and Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Legend has it that Mayer Amschel Rothschildâs âgenius and financial skillsâ were inherited by his sons, but the truth is quite a different story, as Dr. Coleman makes very clear in this well documented account that goes far beyond the best known legends cloaking the true character of the family. Exactly how Mayer Amschel Rothschild âstruck it luckyâ and the steps he took that brought the family from obscurity to âvirtual rulers of all Europe,â makes fascinating reading. This outstanding book is not only about the past, it is also about the present and the future. It will help to explain many of the events that perplex the ordinary people like the war in Iraq and the war threats against Iran.

This book by Dr. John Coleman, author of The Committee of 300, tells how Mayer Amschel, the founder of the âRed Shieldâ dynasty, acquired his first fortune. It is a far cry from the myths and legends that still surround the man who began as a rag and bone merchant and pawnbroker, working out of a small house on Judenstrasse, Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, where he lived with his wife and family. The events attributed to history are often caused by a âhidden handâ pulling the strings of kings, emperors, princes and potentates from behind the scenes. This phenomenon is explained, and the legends that have grown up around the Rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the Rothschildâs intriguing that brought down men like Napoleon and Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Legend has it that Mayer Amschel Rothschildâs âgenius and financial skillsâ were inherited by his sons, but the truth is quite a different story, as Dr. Coleman makes very clear in this well documented account that goes far beyond the best known legends cloaking the true character of the family. Exactly how Mayer Amschel Rothschild âstruck it luckyâ and the steps he took that brought the family from obscurity to âvirtual rulers of all Europe,â makes fascinating reading. This outstanding book is not only about the past, it is also about the present and the future. It will help to explain many of the events that perplex the ordinary people like the war in Iraq and the war threats against Iran.

This phenomenon is explained, and the legends that have grown up around the Rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the Rothschildâs intriguing that brought down men like Napoleon and Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Legend has it that Mayer Amschel Rothschildâs âgenius and financial skillsâ were inherited by his sons, but the truth is quite a different story, as Dr. Coleman makes very clear in this well documented account that goes far beyond the best known legends cloaking the true character of the family. Exactly how Mayer Amschel Rothschild âstruck it luckyâ and the steps he took that brought the family from obscurity to âvirtual rulers of all Europe,â makes fascinating reading. This outstanding book is not only about the past, it is also about the present and the future. It will help to explain many of the events that perplex the ordinary people like the war in Iraq and the war threats against Iran.
0 So why is Lady DeRotshchild so concered about the dems losing the election if her nephew Philip is pushing McCain? Is there a split between her husband Evelyn Rothschild and his brother Jacob, whose son hosted a fundraiser for John McCain?if u have billions of dollars, u buy both candidates --what's a couple million when u have billions (thousands of millions)  the Rothschild family has allegedly been highly involved on both ends of the political spectrum for hundreds of years and have even allegedly been involved in coercion of markets through media and black-ops along with JP Morgan interests and the Rockefellers.  Those are three families that the fringe conspiracy research community have addressed for decades. It's just strange how Bearn Stearns collapses and is eaten up by JP Morgan Chase (formerly run by David Rockefeller) last fall and now the Rothschilds are very publicly pushing the one party system, masquerading as two.  The 'conspiracy theorists' are gaining more validity by the day.She must have huge balls, and should be pushing a wheel barrow to accuse Obama of being an elitest ,, I sat back and laughed that she dare say this with a straight face. Who's kidding who, she would change parties to support the candidate that can be influenced to support an attack on Iran,, that must mean she thinks McCain will do it while Obama will use diplomacy.the Rothschilds literally bank the intellectual laziness of the American people.She is helping the Obama campaign by making such nonsensical comments and will people will look at her as they do McCain , he doesnt know how many houses he owns, with a wife worth a fortune, how she understand what the middle class is suffering and call Obama an "elitest". What difference does it make? U conspiracy theorist believe everyone in government is part of NWO. McCain, Obama, or Clinton what's the point of this. Its all the same conclusion. World domination.No Eddie, I don't believe they're in control of every candidate. They're an interlocking group at Bilderberg. It's not all one big conspiracy. There are circles of influence and infighting, I'm sure.  It's not difficult at all to trace the Clintons, Bushes, McCains, Bidens and Obamas of the world to mega powerful corporations whose vice-presidents and board members meet with agents of the two parties at various forums and conferences, Bilderberg being one of them. It's a revolving door of private finance and corporate and state alliances that border on fascism. When each candidate is only a degree or two removed from each other through influence peddlers who've traveled back and forth between the political and financial world and can be documented as to making a killing off the post-9/11 thiefdom economy, you've got a problem.  It's not so easily though, to connect Ron Paul (republican), Ralph Nader (independent), Cynthia McKinney (green) and Bob Barr (libertarian) to the same network of Iraq war marketers and opportunists. well nate think of it this way. The european banking cartels have been finacing both sides of every war for 200+ years. there is where you should look.  or here. Kinds of a funny about the fed.   http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26754130 The House of Rothschild was worth billions well over a century ago.Â  Today they are likely to be worth hundreds of trillions of dollars.    This book by Dr. John Coleman, author of The Committee of 300, tells how Mayer Amschel, the founder of the âRed Shieldâ dynasty, acquired his first fortune. It is a far cry from the myths and legends that still surround the man who began as a rag and bone merchant and pawnbroker, working out of a small house on Judenstrasse, Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, where he lived with his wife and family. The events attributed to history are often caused by a âhidden handâ pulling the strings of kings, emperors, princes and potentates from behind the scenes. This phenomenon is explained, and the legends that have grown up around the Rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the Rothschildâs intriguing that brought down men like Napoleon and Tsar Alexander II of Russia.

0   I recommend back  Held Up Bait AliWell the man has Schizophrenia. So he would have to teach him to never go full Schizophrenic.  What is also funny is how this year with Iron Man and Tropic Thunder under his belt people are dick riding Downey, yet I'm sure people skipped or hated all those other films he was in, like Gothika, The Shaggy Dog, Game 6. Just to name a few. Gothika was a bad movie period... Just becasue i hated that movie doesn't mean i didn't like him.. hell I hated the Happening, doesn't mean i hated Mark Walberg who will redeem himself with Max Payne.. And i did see The Shaggy Dog.  Downey has always been a good actor, it was his personal life that got in his way, and Ironman just put him in the comeback seat and he has looked back so far.. whay he said...but will wait for cable...you NEVER go full retard   why can't I see that...i don't know about you guys, but i am still waiting for the sequels to Stealth and Booty Call. ;)  You know, I actually kinda liked Booty Call. Never did see Stealth, though.  It's I Am Sam... ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER BLOODY MADE IMO.  And is in my opinion Sean Penn's best role, i love the way he acts out and brings the character to life  One of the best ever made?...Stitch, are you on the pipe again? Sean Penn rarely misses...he's a great actor

Sean Penn's role as Sam can nearly only be recgonised to as Heath's portrayal as The Joker. Even though they are different characters, yes that i know but both actors brought the characters to life

0 $kala's thug-life baby got ass-handled by a white light heavyweight with pink hair, pink toenails, and a pink mouthpiece in under 15 seconds with a one-footed jab.  Woot.          they'll be telling this story 300 years from now.  'the shot heard around the world' 'david slays goliath'  you can't write fiction as bizarre as the this story, from beginning to end.   The whole Kimbo character was fiction to begin with. He's been handled with the utmost of care since he made the switch to mma and became EliteXC's cash cow that appeals to the white, suburban gangster demographic. He was scheduled to fight the corpse of a light heavyweight that hasn't won a fight in close to 10 years. He instead got knocked out by a man that weighed 30 lbs less standing on one foot.  mma.tv has a .gif of Shaw screaming that Kimbo was being hit in the back of the head when Slice was already staring up at the lights. Truly, it has made my day  http://webpages.charter.net/gline/skala-kimbo_seth-juggo.gif  i think you meant to say that MMA in general appeals to the white, suburban gangster demographic. UFC knows who their market is. 12 boys living in a house together (TUF), heavy metal music at every juncture, etc, etc.  Heh. Fair enough.I was driving to work in West Austin (the pricey part of town) on Thursday, and I saw a white, TapOut-clad teenaged kid driving a new Escalade on rims with 'Team Hughes' stickers all over the back while basing Tupac.  It was quite possibly the proudest moment of my life. I had witnessed the pinnacle of our civilization.what did i say man, kimbo slice cannot stand up to a real mma fighter, perhaps an old timer like shamrock, but not someone whos still young enough to feed themselvesim not afraid to admit that I was a fan of slice. i said as soon as Shamrock weighed in at 206.5 that a lighter fighter would be the most dangerous scenario for an inexperienced gorilla like Kimbo. I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.  that .gif is funny for so many reasons. check out the look an that blonde lady's face or that Elite XC official in front of Shaw.  cant argue with you about that, and to be honest after listening to him talk after the fight, and listening to his interview I think i have more respect for the guy, although i still didnt like the fact that he wouldnt touch gloves. More than anything what i've always disliked about kimbo is his gangster attitude and crew and persona. But again after last night, his humility surprised me. What surprised me even more was the absence of his don king like promoter. perhaps he dropped him, which id respect yet again

UFC knows who their market is. 12 boys living in a house together (TUF), heavy metal music at every juncture, etc, etc.  Heh. Fair enough.I was driving to work in West Austin (the pricey part of town) on Thursday, and I saw a white, TapOut-clad teenaged kid driving a new Escalade on rims with 'Team Hughes' stickers all over the back while basing Tupac.  It was quite possibly the proudest moment of my life. I had witnessed the pinnacle of our civilization.what did i say man, kimbo slice cannot stand up to a real mma fighter, perhaps an old timer like shamrock, but not someone whos still young enough to feed themselvesim not afraid to admit that I was a fan of slice. i said as soon as Shamrock weighed in at 206.5 that a lighter fighter would be the most dangerous scenario for an inexperienced gorilla like Kimbo. I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.  that .gif is funny for so many reasons. check out the look an that blonde lady's face or that Elite XC official in front of Shaw.  cant argue with you about that, and to be honest after listening to him talk after the fight, and listening to his interview I think i have more respect for the guy, although i still didnt like the fact that he wouldnt touch gloves. More than anything what i've always disliked about kimbo is his gangster attitude and crew and persona. But again after last night, his humility surprised me. What surprised me even more was the absence of his don king like promoter. perhaps he dropped him, which id respect yet again  yeah, it was a good story while it lasted and it was telling that it was a former ufc guy that nailed him in a matter of seconds. this may signal the end of XC.  but his story is not over yet because of the ad hoc nature of the fight. slice will fight again and that will tell the story better than this fight.  but it just looked too friggin' easy.

"Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?" the plumber asked, complaining that he was being taxed "more and more for fulfilling the American dream."  "It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance for success too," Obama responded.

0 There has been talk now surrounding this game being turned into a motion picture. concidering this is actually a part of the Star Wars saga I wouldn't be surprised if this does become a movie one day down the line. what does everyone else think?   I hope not. It's a great game and all,but I'd rather see a movie based on something after ROTJ. Enough of the Clone Wars and anything between the existing movies. Give us something new for a change.Oh God! No more fucking Star Wars, please..(!)I think it'll never happen.  I know, seriously! And this is coming from a huge Star Wars fan too. I'm starting to get pretty sick of it.  Well George Lucas swore that there would NEVER be an Epsiode 7,8 and 9 and concidering that Mark Hamill is old now just leaves out the possibility right there as well. Reason I think The Force Unleashed would work is because the story is right there. The story is actually in between the Episodes and is explained well on what happened to the Jedi and who finished them off.  I beaten the game and do believe that alot of the segments would work well in the movie. The part where the secret apprentice takes down a Star Destroyer with his force powers would deffinitally work well in the film as so would his fights against the Jedi he was tasked to kill. Also the ending sequence would most certainly make the film as well if it does happen.  I still have yet to see The Clone Wars movie and TV show and am awaiting the live action Bounty Hunter series due in 2011 but if there is any TRUE Star Wars film to be made it would have to be The Force Unleashed in my own opinion. Star Wars should be left alone, unless it's Knights of the Old Republic and has nothing to do with Lucas. I'm sick of Lucas raping stormtroopers and spitting in the face of fans.  I will admit I would love to see a KOTOR movie but it will not happen until George Lucas sells his rights. I will also go on to admit that Epsidoe 1 n 2 were not so impressive and thankfully Epsiode 3 was THE best in the prequels. The fact Episode 3 took a darker turn was THE best choice for the final installment. Also it isn't George Lycas' fault he cannot direct anymore. Before agreeing to Write/direct Episode 1,2 and 3, George Lucas hasn't directed since Episode 4 which was released in 1977.  After Epsidoe 4 he just produced the Indiana Jones Trilogy and along with Star Wars Episode 5 and 6. It was a shame that Episode 1 n 2 weren't that good but at least they were decent. I still have yet to see The Clone Wars show so there is no telling if George Lucas gotten worse or a tad bit better.  Anyhow I personally think a Force Unleashed film would work if handled right The prequels being 3 of the worst movies is hardly a secret.The only redeeming quality of the three were Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul, and in typical Lucas fashion he took the only good things in the films and killed them. Hayden Christensen's acting is on par with Keanu Reeves, but considering the ep 1-3 held little continuity to the original 3, I guess his horrible acting falls short of being the top reason things went wrong.  Hayden Christensen was likely THE worst cast for Anakin Sykwalker. I figured either George Lucas either wanted a bargain bin actor or he just couldn't find anyone else to replace him. I remembered after Episode 2 came into theaters it was rumored that Hugh Jackman was to take over the role of Anakin Sykwalker. Reason that was the rumor was because it was said at the time that Episode 3 would take place a big amount of years after Episode 2.  It was right when Episode 3 went into production that everyone around saw that the rumor was false and Hayden was back.I personally liked Episode 3 alot and did appreciate alot of the things in it. I liked the entire beginning with the battle over Coruscant took place which lead to the duel between Anakin and Count Dooku.  I also liked how the emperor held a lightsaber and did combat with Yoda and also the whole battle sequence between General Grievous and Obi Wan was surely entertaining. I liked Episode 3 and it would be entertaining to see The Force Unleashed turned into a film. if it is written well and has a good director on board I would be satisfied.  If The Force Unleashed is turned into a film I would highly doubt George Lucas would direct. He would most likely co write and probably produce. The least Star Wars brand he would direct would be some of the episodes on the upcoming live action TV show due in late 2011.

I remembered after Episode 2 came into theaters it was rumored that Hugh Jackman was to take over the role of Anakin Sykwalker. Reason that was the rumor was because it was said at the time that Episode 3 would take place a big amount of years after Episode 2.  It was right when Episode 3 went into production that everyone around saw that the rumor was false and Hayden was back.I personally liked Episode 3 alot and did appreciate alot of the things in it. I liked the entire beginning with the battle over Coruscant took place which lead to the duel between Anakin and Count Dooku.  I also liked how the emperor held a lightsaber and did combat with Yoda and also the whole battle sequence between General Grievous and Obi Wan was surely entertaining. I liked Episode 3 and it would be entertaining to see The Force Unleashed turned into a film. if it is written well and has a good director on board I would be satisfied.  If The Force Unleashed is turned into a film I would highly doubt George Lucas would direct. He would most likely co write and probably produce. The least Star Wars brand he would direct would be some of the episodes on the upcoming live action TV show due in late 2011.Ok one Force Unleashed wouldn't work...  Why because Dath Vader is best left where he is and also where the fuck would this new apprentice fit into the whole saga without being mentioned in Episode 4 - 6. Because remember that Force Unleashed is set during the time span of 3 - 4. What happen inbetween that big gap in the saga. Its best left as a game and nothing more. And come on can they really find anyone else to do Darth Vader.   KOTOR has acctually been in discussion and George Lucas apparently expressed interested in the project as a motion picture film in 2 films, after he completed Episode III. But Lucas then decided to cancel and wipe away the idea and revealed that the ideas he had written and expressed down that would have appeared in the two KOTOR movies, will now appear some where in the anticipated Live Action Star Wars Series, which may never come, since its been in pre-production God knows how long
0 Oh God! No more fucking Star Wars, please..(!)I think it'll never happen.  I know, seriously! And this is coming from a huge Star Wars fan too. I'm starting to get pretty sick of it.  Well George Lucas swore that there would NEVER be an Epsiode 7,8 and 9 and concidering that Mark Hamill is old now just leaves out the possibility right there as well. Reason I think The Force Unleashed would work is because the story is right there. The story is actually in between the Episodes and is explained well on what happened to the Jedi and who finished them off.  I beaten the game and do believe that alot of the segments would work well in the movie. The part where the secret apprentice takes down a Star Destroyer with his force powers would deffinitally work well in the film as so would his fights against the Jedi he was tasked to kill. Also the ending sequence would most certainly make the film as well if it does happen.  I still have yet to see The Clone Wars movie and TV show and am awaiting the live action Bounty Hunter series due in 2011 but if there is any TRUE Star Wars film to be made it would have to be The Force Unleashed in my own opinion. Star Wars should be left alone, unless it's Knights of the Old Republic and has nothing to do with Lucas. I'm sick of Lucas raping stormtroopers and spitting in the face of fans.  I will admit I would love to see a KOTOR movie but it will not happen until George Lucas sells his rights. I will also go on to admit that Epsidoe 1 n 2 were not so impressive and thankfully Epsiode 3 was THE best in the prequels. The fact Episode 3 took a darker turn was THE best choice for the final installment. Also it isn't George Lycas' fault he cannot direct anymore. Before agreeing to Write/direct Episode 1,2 and 3, George Lucas hasn't directed since Episode 4 which was released in 1977.  After Epsidoe 4 he just produced the Indiana Jones Trilogy and along with Star Wars Episode 5 and 6. It was a shame that Episode 1 n 2 weren't that good but at least they were decent. I still have yet to see The Clone Wars show so there is no telling if George Lucas gotten worse or a tad bit better.  Anyhow I personally think a Force Unleashed film would work if handled right The prequels being 3 of the worst movies is hardly a secret.The only redeeming quality of the three were Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul, and in typical Lucas fashion he took the only good things in the films and killed them.

I would not mind more SW films at all, but they would have to fit the story line that is already in place.

In the past films other people filled in for the suit and James Earl Jones just did the voice over work on the character. I think the story could work for many reasons. One reason is that George Lucas produced and okayed the story for the game so if there is actually a movie he would okay the movie script since he was involved closely with the game.  Also the film could fit in really well into the saga. The reason the secret apprentice wasn't mentioned in Episode 4-6 is because he was a "secret" apprentice. Noone was allowd to know of his existence which makes logical sense as well. I think the film could work and possibly go into production in the coming years. The Episodes may be done but doesn't mean there can't be side story films to be made.  As for the TV series. George Lucas and his producer Rick Maccallum said recently that the 2 are sitting down with TV writers to get the much anticipated Star Wars live action show underway. So far what is said about the TV show is it won't have Jedi or even Darth Vader in it and would more or less focus on Bounty Hunters like bobba Fett. I am pretty hyped for the show but it isn't due til 2011

In the past films other people filled in for the suit and James Earl Jones just did the voice over work on the character. I think the story could work for many reasons. One reason is that George Lucas produced and okayed the story for the game so if there is actually a movie he would okay the movie script since he was involved closely with the game.  Also the film could fit in really well into the saga. The reason the secret apprentice wasn't mentioned in Episode 4-6 is because he was a "secret" apprentice. Noone was allowd to know of his existence which makes logical sense as well. I think the film could work and possibly go into production in the coming years. The Episodes may be done but doesn't mean there can't be side story films to be made.  As for the TV series. George Lucas and his producer Rick Maccallum said recently that the 2 are sitting down with TV writers to get the much anticipated Star Wars live action show underway. So far what is said about the TV show is it won't have Jedi or even Darth Vader in it and would more or less focus on Bounty Hunters like bobba Fett. I am pretty hyped for the show but it isn't due til 2011 when they came to arrest Lucas at the end of the show they caught him raping a stormtrooper.
0  Star Wars should be left alone, unless it's Knights of the Old Republic and has nothing to do with Lucas. I'm sick of Lucas raping stormtroopers and spitting in the face of fans.  I will admit I would love to see a KOTOR movie but it will not happen until George Lucas sells his rights. I will also go on to admit that Epsidoe 1 n 2 were not so impressive and thankfully Epsiode 3 was THE best in the prequels. The fact Episode 3 took a darker turn was THE best choice for the final installment. Also it isn't George Lycas' fault he cannot direct anymore. Before agreeing to Write/direct Episode 1,2 and 3, George Lucas hasn't directed since Episode 4 which was released in 1977.  After Epsidoe 4 he just produced the Indiana Jones Trilogy and along with Star Wars Episode 5 and 6. It was a shame that Episode 1 n 2 weren't that good but at least they were decent. I still have yet to see The Clone Wars show so there is no telling if George Lucas gotten worse or a tad bit better.  Anyhow I personally think a Force Unleashed film would work if handled right The prequels being 3 of the worst movies is hardly a secret.The only redeeming quality of the three were Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul, and in typical Lucas fashion he took the only good things in the films and killed them. Hayden Christensen's acting is on par with Keanu Reeves, but considering the ep 1-3 held little continuity to the original 3, I guess his horrible acting falls short of being the top reason things went wrong.  Hayden Christensen was likely THE worst cast for Anakin Sykwalker. I figured either George Lucas either wanted a bargain bin actor or he just couldn't find anyone else to replace him. I remembered after Episode 2 came into theaters it was rumored that Hugh Jackman was to take over the role of Anakin Sykwalker. Reason that was the rumor was because it was said at the time that Episode 3 would take place a big amount of years after Episode 2.  It was right when Episode 3 went into production that everyone around saw that the rumor was false and Hayden was back.I personally liked Episode 3 alot and did appreciate alot of the things in it. I liked the entire beginning with the battle over Coruscant took place which lead to the duel between Anakin and Count Dooku.  I also liked how the emperor held a lightsaber and did combat with Yoda and also the whole battle sequence between General Grievous and Obi Wan was surely entertaining. I liked Episode 3 and it would be entertaining to see The Force Unleashed turned into a film. if it is written well and has a good director on board I would be satisfied.  If The Force Unleashed is turned into a film I would highly doubt George Lucas would direct. He would most likely co write and probably produce. The least Star Wars brand he would direct would be some of the episodes on the upcoming live action TV show due in late 2011.Ok one Force Unleashed wouldn't work...  Why because Dath Vader is best left where he is and also where the fuck would this new apprentice fit into the whole saga without being mentioned in Episode 4 - 6. Because remember that Force Unleashed is set during the time span of 3 - 4. What happen inbetween that big gap in the saga. Its best left as a game and nothing more. And come on can they really find anyone else to do Darth Vader.   KOTOR has acctually been in discussion and George Lucas apparently expressed interested in the project as a motion picture film in 2 films, after he completed Episode III. But Lucas then decided to cancel and wipe away the idea and revealed that the ideas he had written and expressed down that would have appeared in the two KOTOR movies, will now appear some where in the anticipated Live Action Star Wars Series, which may never come, since its been in pre-production God knows how longI'm not sure how I would feel about it joining the other films, but the TV spot for the game almost made me run out and buy a PS3 !  I would not mind more SW films at all, but they would have to fit the story line that is already in place.  I thought he raped Indiana Jones?  Nah Indiana Jones got raped by a stormtrooper, that got raped by Lucas ;)  Who knows whose gonna get raped by Lucas next probably Jar Jar's son  Well James Earl Jones is still alive and could do the vocal work for Darth Vader.

0 After so many broken promises, integration is key.By Alfred Kokh  from the October 15, 2008 edition  Moscow - It's a truism that stable and friendly relations between two countries require each to look at a situation from the other's point of view. The recent tussle between Russia and the West over Georgia is a stark reminder of how the United States has fundamentally never understood Russia's point of view.  The conventional view is that Russia in recent years has been pushing away from the West. But the reverse is more accurate. The Russia-Georgia conflict is a consequence of the West's "pushing away" of Russia.  Russia needed a good friend to stand by her side the past 15 years, to counsel her on becoming an open, democratic country tightly bound to the West. Russia thought it had found a friend in America. Unfortunately, despite the desire of Russia's newly formed leadership to move closer to the West, to be integrated to Western institutions, there was no move to meet Russia partway. All issues of integration were talked away during the many years of negotiations, and all questions of economic aid ended up as miserly loans from the World Bank.  Having worked in Boris Yeltsin's government as a deputy prime minister, I know how the West tried to persuade Russia to take on the entire foreign debt of the former USSR. Russia agreed to take this very difficult step in the hope that the West would appreciate its sacrifice and begin seeing the world through its eyes. Unfortunately that did not happen. Yeltsin's government ended up with almost no allies or supporters in Russia. He was perceived as a puppet of the West, his policies dictated by the US. It should come as no surprise, then, that Vladimir Putin came to power as he did in 1999.  Now, the West considers Prime Minister Putin a foe of democracy. But he was the first to support America after 9/11, and he provided substantial help in organizing operations in Afghanistan. Putin made simple requests in return: membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), dropping visa entry requirements to European Union (EU) countries, and significant cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). All this was promised to him and none of it happened.  Let's imagine for a moment that Russia had been integrated into the West. Then the corruption of the Russian judicial system and its susceptibility to administrative pressure would be balanced by European judicial institutions and the imperfections of its electoral system would be muted by European legislation and the European parliament. The government's economic policies would be in accord with the norms of the EU and WTO and Russia's military independence would be constrained by NATO rules. The human rights situation in Russia would be very different.  The West would only win in this scenario. Instead, it has surrounded Russia with missiles and radar stations and accumulated conventional weapons in close proximity to its borders. It would be naive to expect Russia to make concessions such as ratifying the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty under these conditions. Opinion polls show that promoting pro-Western policies in Russia today without an equivalent response from the West would be political suicide for Russian leaders. Neither the military establishment nor citizens would support such concessions.  The situation in Georgia is a global embarrassment, a tale of contradictions. And, the reaction from Russians and Americans is, simply put, ironic. Russian leaders were crying crocodile tears over the genocide of Ossetians, and voicing outrage over the shelling of Tskhinvali. But they had done the very same thing in Chechnya just a few years ago. The American administration is no better, attacking Iraq for bogus reasons, destroying an entire nation, inciting further religious terrorism, and killing tens of thousands of civilians.  To understand Russia's actions in Georgia, the West must first understand that Russia does not see herself as the losing side that must be punished for the cold war. Second, there is a dangerous historic precedent: In 1919, the Entente forced Germany to sign the humiliating Treaty of Versailles. Historians suggest that the repercussions of that Treaty led to World War II. Had the Allies looked at the situation from the German point of view, history may have taken a better course.  Perhaps the conflict in the Caucasus will at least force the West to talk to Russia about real integration â WTO membership, for example. For if Russia continues to be "pushed away" â left alone with its anxieties and the anxieties of its leaders â relations will definitely sour. Do not forget how many nuclear warheads Russia has and how many Russians want to save the country's honor.   â¢ Alfred Kokh is the author of the upcoming book, "A Crate of Vodka: An Insider View On The 20 Years That Shaped Modern Russia."

I wouldn't, but I have been raised with stories from where we did it last time.  "Limeys"??

A VERY flimpsy retort. The "I've got black friends" statement, or "I shagged a black" excuse also doesn't carry water these days :)  Have you married a London woman? As well as is there such thing as a Anglophobe or is it knowledge and caution? No Austrian girl ever hit me in the head with a bottle...  that is VERY speculative thinking.

0 She's constantly being told what to, what to say, etc. Rightly, so. She's a complete retard! Didn't MCain know what he was getting himself into when choosing this chick?? When she speaks for herself...horrible things happen for the GOP candidate. They should have known better!   CNN) -- Some aides to Sen. John McCain say they weren't happy that running mate Sarah Palin went off script Sunday and turned attention back to the controversy over her wardrobe.Several McCain advisers suggested that they have become increasingly frustrated with what one aide described as Palin "going rogue."She's a maverick.   *wink*I love this line in the article:  "A Palin aide, however, told CNN that the governor clearly felt like she had to say something to defend herself, because "that's really not who she is."    What's that old saying? If it walks like a duck.....   I don't care that the RNC paid for the wardrobe and it was not illegal. I find it excessive and wasteful. Furthermore; her attempt(s) to justify it are lame.It is possible that Palin's strengths as a personality were not capitalized properly by the McCain campaign. Her expensive makeover, for example, might not have been so radically necessary if the idea were to push the hockey mom image more.  But I think there are some pretty obvious reasons why the campaign wants to control Palin rather tightly. Upon introduction of Palin, the talk was as if Obama and Palin were the ones directly contesting for office.  This obviously would be damaging to McCain so you would have to think that McCain's advisers would want to redirect the focus on the main candidate and, also, bring Palin under wing in terms of talking points ... the way that the McCain advisers see the issues to be.  Rollins refers to the problem as mishandling Palin which does not underscore whether he saw Palin as an asset for substantive issues.  Bill Kristol, an early and still vocal champion of Palin feels that she should have been let loose to just speak her mind ... within bounds, presumably.  Either way, her role was to keep the hopes of a major BOP base alive and active and she has done that.  That there are GOP opinion leaders that have moved away from the campaign to support Obama isn't simply a matter of Palin having been mishandled, imo.  Personally, I rather think that, like it or not, if one is voting for McCain for POTUS, one is also, essentially, voting for Palin for the same office, at some point. 72 is a seasoned age, and it could be argued that the John McCain of 72 is far from the John McCain of 64. At any rate, the chances of Palin stepping into the position some time in the next 4 years is significant.  That having been said, this is the woman who flatly stated that the VPOTUS runs the Senate, and can really get in there and mix it up and change things with the senators.  *shudder*Like I said before. Get a time machine and bring McCain 00 back from the past to beat the snot out of McCain 08.  QFT.   Oh, from the outside looking in, you're right.  But from inside the McCain campaign ... the notion that a candidate runs with a verity that he may die due to his age and health in office isn't in the playbook. So it is McCain first, Palin second and only in a supporting role.  Palin stealing headlines from Obama is one thing but also pushing McCain off the headlines is not acceptable.  It was important to get the base back with him because his position with them hasn't always been a totally warm and fuzzy experience. Palin was the answer, it seems. The question really is, though, how big is that base today compared to previous elections?  Vocal, the base may be but how many are still in that base? I have my doubts that it is as big as it once was. It is still sizable and McCain needs them to have a prayer of chance of winning but I am a little skeptical about its current size partly because of Palin and what her stronpoints at re-activating that base happen to be.  Good point, as always, old friend.

It's sad...yet scary to think...  She had no idea what she was getting herself into...and now she's unknowingly destroying the GOP's chances.  Poor McCain. Well, at least the Reps gave him his chance before he kicked the bucket.

0 He was the best Joker to have graced a batman movie. An amazing actor....too bad he died  Opinions?You must be new. Welcome.I haven't seen TDK...so based on every thing else...well, I didn't care much for his work....I did like him in that teenny bopper movie...The 10 Things I hate About you.... You didn't like Lords of Dogtown?I thought he was pretty good in Candy.he was amazing in Brokeback Mountain,even though that movie was a little weak.i watched 'a knights tale' last night but to me paul bettany is the better one in it.He was good in 'I'm Not There', though Cate Blanchett stole the movie with her performance. I think he was a bit over rated for his actual body of work. If he hadn't died, his performance as the Joker would have been the start of something really big for him. The Dark Knight seems to have spurred many, many people who never saw a Heath Ledger movie before to go back and review his earlier work.Heath was an always be the definitive JOKER....

I thought Jack Nicholson was a really good Joker though.I don't know what the big deal was about the Dark Knight, batman's voice was stupid and over done and heath ledger did a horrible job. Im glad he died. Nothing beats Jack Nickolson's performance of the Joker  so many things wrong with what you just said.  you are a fucking douchebag for being glad that Ledger is dead and Ledger was great in it.All he did was lick his lips and stuttered like he had something in his ass, not so great.

1 Oh, and you live in California. Lotta douchebags out there.  haha... Welcome to the movie forum!  If you say you didn't like TDK... All the trolls and fanboys come out of the woodwork to defends Heaths' half ass potrayal of the Joker.  Get used to it... (apparently it's all they got):(  Heath's Joker was the closest to Joker in the comics. I suggest you read The Killing Joker, and you'll understand.  Heath is how the Joker was originally written. Jack's Joker was how DC changed him back in the 50's and 60's where they made him more a practical joker then a homicidal mad man.  But to each their own. Ok Johnnie. You and the dumbass that you're defending need to go back and read the previous posts that said dumbass contributed to this thread.  Those posts are what makes him a dumbass, not the fact that he doen't like TDK.  One of his lesser known movies. He was good in it. His career was barely taking off though, and to be bad he passed away at such a young age.  You come off as a jerk because you said that you're glad Heath's dead because you didn't like his performance in The Dark Knight. It's ok if you didn't like the movie or Heath's performance, but to say that you're glad he's dead is what makes someone say you have a low IQ.  In career terms that's the tragic thing about his death, that he seemed to be coming into his own as a great actor.  I'd say fully emerging yourself into a character that has serious mental issues is a lot more traumatizing than playing a character that has a homosexual relationship. I never saw it....:(....I love skater movies, too...hmm...why did I not see this? I saw some interview with Nicholson when Ledger died...he said he had warned him about the character...or something like that...I think if you get that run down by a character, you are a kook to begin with...and maybe should lay off the narcotics

0   Um...he's right.  He's got a good point. At least he knows a lot more than everyone here...So basically, he's saying what? That he can't hire people in this country to do with the jobs? Even with the tech visa program? Bullshit. And those support jobs? Guess where they're going? Yup, to India. He may hire tech support people, but they're in a support center in India. Either taht or they are temporary contract workers.  You did realize that he is the reason that companies won't keep a temp worker past a certain time, right? Because gates fired all his hourly non-exempt staff, then hired them back as contract workers? He kept them for years as contract workers. The only difference was that now, he didn' t have to pay benefits or give them the stock options that he had promised them when he hired them as regular workers. The workers sued and won.  Bullshit. Why can't they hire americans for those jobs? Because the majority of engineering majors in america are foreigners. Did you knowÂ that?  Most them would like to stay here to work afer their studies, but immigration policies doesn't alllow it...Bill Gates does not support the american people, only his walletSomeone please bring up Lou Dobbs....I can see it coming....  Same problem occuring over this side of the pond. 'cept we keep the ones that graduate.  Ours hasn't progressed that badly. Secondary and College is free, University can be done via a special loan from Gov. So theres no money restricting someone if they want to go Uni. We open our colleges to Europeans and immigrants who are hard working tbh, but then you hear the small amount of British complaining how immigrants are "stealing jobs" (when immigrants do it better)In spite of what gates has to say Co. can pay HB-1 employees less than they would pay an American grad I know several that weren't able to get work so went into other fields now CEOs want to complain maybe they should hire cits first instead of paying att. to tell them how not to.

0 Oh look, another "I support Hillary and if Obama gets the nomination, I'm voting for McCain out of spite because I'm a sore loser." thread. Wonderful.Hillary would suck the blood out of an unborn fetus to get the nomination.  That's true with almost all politicians.   ewwww and pretty much. Not really...here's the 3 candidates for you...  Hillary wants to be President because she thinks it's her divine right. McCain wants to be President to keep our nation at perpetual war. Obama wants to be President because-no matter how naive it may seem-he actually thinks he can make a difference.  This is the first time since I've been able to vote that I've thought about sitting one out.McCain still has an uphill battle regardless of who wins the Democratic nomination.   It depends on your perspective I think. If you are a conservative, yea, most definetly. If you are an independent....not so much. I personally don't think Obama is electable. Hillary will steal it if she has to.   and we all know how accurate the polls are.   Eh he will beat Hillary in a landslide but with Obama the election can be very close.  QFT.  S'up, civilian. Good to see you're still kickin.

Obama wants to be President because-no matter how naive it may seem-he actually thinks he can make a difference.  This is the first time since I've been able to vote that I've thought about sitting one out.McCain still has an uphill battle regardless of who wins the Democratic nomination.   It depends on your perspective I think. If you are a conservative, yea, most definetly. If you are an independent....not so much. I personally don't think Obama is electable. Hillary will steal it if she has to.   and we all know how accurate the polls are.   Eh he will beat Hillary in a landslide but with Obama the election can be very close.  QFT.  S'up, civilian. Good to see you're still kickin.   Gawd, we're fucked.  :(

0 Stop bailing out the lenders and let the market work itself out.  Any kind of tax increase would be a disaster.  Cut taxes? what about that soring debt? or the massive military we have or the national infustructure? All of that shit costs money. Social programs would be a drop in the bucket if we let continue spending this much on an Army and this massive infustructure.bumpWhen it comes to the economy the only thing you can really do is pray.The first thing I do, when I'm low on cash?  Stop spending.  The second?  Raise my income (find a new job, or for the government, raise revenue).  I think this is a good general order. And spend those rebate checks on Chinese goods! Plasma tvs for everyone! Yippee! plasma? please. Everyone knows the market is shifting towards LCDs.  Bring the troops home, that will save us trillions, and when i say bring the troops home i mean from 130 countries.gotta do something.  lower corporate tax, make infrastructure improvements to make america's economy more competitive abroad first off.  also, ease visa restrictions on highly skilled technical labour.It's a pretty simple prescription, really. Cut taxes, cut spending, and STOP INFLATING!  That should fly with politicians and the public about as well as recommendations for diet and exercise to improve their health. Why go to all that pain and effort, when there just HAS to be a magic pill that can fix it all?

Withdrawing our forces from peaceful overseas assignments will cripple several national economies worldwide and cause an international economic crisis.  facts?   Take a world economics class, then delve into the finer points of the Defense Budget. For example, the U.S. doesn't own any of the land in the countries it has forces stationed (peacefully or otherwise). The land is rented. In Germany money is paid to the German Government every time a military vehicle is driving off of the installation. The German Government is paid a fee every time a hole is dug on the military installation itself, too. Same thing with the use of the rifle range. Let's not even get into the millions of dollars spent every year by the troops themselves within the country (the alcohol purchase alone would fund a couple of social programs here in the U.S.).  When we first set up the airbase in Hungary in support of the Operation Joint Endeavor in 1995 we almost tripled two-thirds of the country's Gross National Product.  South Korea actually only pays about 20% of their defense budget; we handle the rest in accordance of their treaty. If we were to just up and leave, they'd have to make up that last 80% in the face of North Korea's "million man army."  Need more examples?

0   Bring the troops home, that will save us trillions, and when i say bring the troops home i mean from 130 countries.gotta do something.  lower corporate tax, make infrastructure improvements to make america's economy more competitive abroad first off.  also, ease visa restrictions on highly skilled technical labour.It's a pretty simple prescription, really. Cut taxes, cut spending, and STOP INFLATING!  That should fly with politicians and the public about as well as recommendations for diet and exercise to improve their health. Why go to all that pain and effort, when there just HAS to be a magic pill that can fix it all?Who said anything about being an isolationist? Its about being a non-interventionist and mind your own business but still trade and travel. Do you call other countries isolationist because they dont police the world?  Our troops being stationed in other countries such as Germany and Japan have more to do with international economical matters than anything else. Withdrawing our forces from peaceful overseas assignments will cripple several national economies worldwide and cause an international economic crisis.  facts?   Take a world economics class, then delve into the finer points of the Defense Budget. For example, the U.S. doesn't own any of the land in the countries it has forces stationed (peacefully or otherwise). The land is rented. In Germany money is paid to the German Government every time a military vehicle is driving off of the installation. The German Government is paid a fee every time a hole is dug on the military installation itself, too. Same thing with the use of the rifle range. Let's not even get into the millions of dollars spent every year by the troops themselves within the country (the alcohol purchase alone would fund a couple of social programs here in the U.S.).  When we first set up the airbase in Hungary in support of the Operation Joint Endeavor in 1995 we almost tripled two-thirds of the country's Gross National Product.

And spewing Ron Paul blogs?  Uhmmmm... buddy, despite what the UN is and does (which, in case you didnt know, is a multi-national collaborative entity BTW and is not made up solely of the US), that doesn't discredit the world's general opinion about the US.  Especially when the UN says, "No, you can't invade iraq", and the US says "Too bad, what are you going to do?" Sicne that IS basically how it went down.  The US government does what it wants, regardless of what the UN wants. The US only "abides" by the UN when it's convenient for them. It's a big fucking joke. So don't try and back the US and opinion with the collaborative effors of the UN - because then you just end up looking like a complete jackass.

Uhmmmm... buddy, despite what the UN is and does (which, in case you didnt know, is a multi-national collaborative entity BTW and is not made up solely of the US), that doesn't discredit the world's general opinion about the US.  Especially when the UN says, "No, you can't invade iraq", and the US says "Too bad, what are you going to do?" Sicne that IS basically how it went down.  The US government does what it wants, regardless of what the UN wants. The US only "abides" by the UN when it's convenient for them. It's a big fucking joke. So don't try and back the US and opinion with the collaborative effors of the UN - because then you just end up looking like a complete jackass.  are you arguing that i should be responsible for subsidizing the germany economy?
0 Believe me, guys, I'm very much a "take care of our own first" kinda guy. I firmly believe we should withdraw all forces from overseas, peaceful or otherwise. I don't see the need for 14 active Aircraft Carriers plus escorts, either. I also hate the fact that so much of our own economy is tied up in the world market, as well as the fact that we pay out billions in foreign aid when we've got people starving in the streets.  I'm a staunch isolationist; always have been.  However, what I like and don't like doesn't change the facts. I'm willing to make the sacrifices necessary to withdraw into our shells and take care of ourselves first, but I can't make that choice for the rest of the country (which is why I will never run for office). What's good for me isn't always good for everyone else.  So what he says in this video isn't true?           Next-Gen Nuke Subs and F-22s I'm okay with, although not nearly in the number we are building. We need to stay on top as far as conventional military technology is concerned, and I'm okay with a few wings of $130+ billion aircraft.

0 http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,399921,00.html  Entire commentary.Let's go with you racism comment. After slavery racism trapped African Americans in Poor neighborhoods and they couldn't get out. Today there is a flow of African Americans leaving the poor neighborhoods but not that many. The reason they are democrats is because the democrats support government handouts and the Republicans do not. African Americans that are stuck in poverty couldn't survive without this. Why would they vote Republican? But the successful African Americans, Middle and Upper class, I'll bet a good percentage of them vote Republican.I agree with Rodney.Yeah republicans are race baiters?  I think that is delusional.   So what you are really saying is that poor people favor democrats. But if that was the case, why aren't the majority of poor white amaericans also democrat? Statistically more white people rely on social services than blacks.   Please explian why Reagan would choose to deliver his first campaign speech in Mississippi, at the urging of Trent Lott no less, a known bigot and racist.  This is exactly the kind of denial that the article talks about. Don't forget the nice image of the black welfare queen that reagan so lovingly implanted in so many brains.  If I remember correctly, the freedmen became sharecroppers and then moved to the cities when industry took off. And then industry left, leaving blacks in ghettos with no job skills in service.  If I am wrong, correct me. I slept 4 hours last night.Trent Lott once said, "The country would have been better off had segregationist candidate Strom Thurmond been voted into office." Nah you said republicans as a blanket statement.  Black politicians take more advantage of their own race than anyone else. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton.

If you read the article, the author suggests that it is a good thing that Bush is reaching out to black voters finally, but it will not work until the republican party adresses it's racism in the past.  I've yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech, repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights, in Philadelphia, MI, the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s' ugliest cases of racist violence. It was a ringing declaration of his support for "states' rights" â a code word for resistance to black advances clearly understood by white Southern voters.  If this wasn't race baiting, what was it? Please explain.

Statistically more white people rely on social services than blacks.   Please explian why Reagan would choose to deliver his first campaign speech in Mississippi, at the urging of Trent Lott no less, a known bigot and racist.  This is exactly the kind of denial that the article talks about. Don't forget the nice image of the black welfare queen that reagan so lovingly implanted in so many brains.  If I remember correctly, the freedmen became sharecroppers and then moved to the cities when industry took off. And then industry left, leaving blacks in ghettos with no job skills in service.  If I am wrong, correct me. I slept 4 hours last night.Trent Lott once said, "The country would have been better off had segregationist candidate Strom Thurmond been voted into office." Nah you said republicans as a blanket statement.  Black politicians take more advantage of their own race than anyone else. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton.  I didn't say all republicans are racist, what I said rather, was that the republican party has a history of racism. Also, the republican party is in denial about this and this is exactly why most blacks will not vote for a republican.  If you read the article, the author suggests that it is a good thing that Bush is reaching out to black voters finally, but it will not work until the republican party adresses it's racism in the past.  I've yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech, repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights, in Philadelphia, MI, the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s' ugliest cases of racist violence. It was a ringing declaration of his support for "states' rights" â a code word for resistance to black advances clearly understood by white Southern voters.  If this wasn't race baiting, what was it? Please explain. Good point...  Thankyou. Where are all these Reagan Conservatives I keep hearing about? I really hope their silence on this topic is because they are all deep in contemplation, wrestling with their own inner demons.  I'll assume that.  No, blacks were not given access to credit and property in the manner that whites were due to racism. In the 60's many black neighborhoods were destroyed to make the interstate highway system, the replacement was high density public housing. In 68, when king died blacks destroyed their own commercial centers, but these were OWNED by whites and rented to blacks. That was part of the anger, to this day most of these places are still just as they were after the riots. In combination with the drugs that were imported into the cities by Regean to destroy the black pride movement, these things destroyed confidence and morale in the black community, causing them to blame the man. Most of the children from the 70's grew up to be either cynical adults, or backstabbers to the ppl they left behind when they made it, like Barrack and Michelle Obama.

That has to be a huge turn off to black voters.  Interesting to see some of the pundits tackling the issue head on, that can only be a good thing.   Melman isnt a pundit he was the RNC chairman awhile back.
0   So you're a racist too then? Got ya.  I wouldn't have said that, no matter how close a friend he was to me. The fact is he's a racist, so is Lott, and Lott even went on a crying jag apologizing left and right for his remarks.  Even he thinks it was wrong.   This was addressed Ken Mellman did apologized for the use of the Southern Stragety but many hardcore conservatives like Hannity and Limbaugh said that its a waste of time.  A long time ago, where as the republican party is blatantly racist and within many of our lifetimes.  He was longtime good friends with James Brown, and actually pleaded on his behalf when Brown got locked up later in life. He changed his ways.  America itself has a history of racism, what is your point? The Democratic Party certainly has a long history of racism and race-baiting, hell they are still doing it today!

0 Newsflash, Rome failed too.The rise and fall of nations. What goes up must come down.  Watch the video, it explains why Rome fell. Tisk Tisk...Rome didn't fail, it's still there, I've been there many times. The Roman Empire failed. ;)the government that governs best, governs not at all.The video says that the Constitution is supposed to Govern the Government not the People.  Rome went broke no?Did anyone watch the video?  People are already making assumptions.  This is a great video on how this country is supposed to work.Rome fell because it spread itself too thin militarily, and it's economy started to collapse due to moving more and more to the left (more and more / larger government)...  Sound familiar?  AMAZING video by the way. One everyone should watch.  Exactly  It really didnt have to fail they just had shit policies

I said their government moved more and mroe to the left... they instituted welfare programs, increased taxes, increased the size of the central government and so on. Productivity sank greatly... their economy suffered to an extreme extent... couple that with a military being spread so thin - and the barbarians had their way with them.

Less government, less taxes, the people were free. Later on the Roman politicians started asking for more people and more government bigger government, more taxes, spreading their empire. This caused a collapse of their economy and the Empire broke down. This is what happened to the United States and it might come crashing down just like the Roman Empire.

Can't recall where I heard it, but it always struck me as an interesting thought.What does the Roman Empire have to do with the United States?  So what if they were a republic and they failed? That doesn't mean the US ever will. That's just a stupid argument. That's like saying . . . "oh, Tommy went to college and failed all of his classes, and since Tommy failed, you are doomed to failure too"! Dumb dumb dumb. America won't be on top forever Nichols. It might not crash and burn, but it will fade into the background in time. Nothing lasts forever.  As far as Rome goes, its the first thing to jump out at alot of people when they hear the words "empire" or "republic." We could try comparisons to the Ottomans, but it wouldn't reach as broad an audience.  The reason they compared it to the US is because the Romans had about the same system of government a Republic. Less government, less taxes, the people were free. Later on the Roman politicians started asking for more people and more government bigger government, more taxes, spreading their empire. This caused a collapse of their economy and the Empire broke down. This is what happened to the United States and it might come crashing down just like the Roman Empire. No, I know why they compared it, but my point was that just because one thing fails, doesn't mean the other will.  "untrue".  It's a great video, very informative. I highly recommend it.
1  so mr knowledge, enlighten us to why the roman empire fell if it wasnt for financial collapse.because of free trade... um....  okay? and you accuse others of insanity?Bump  Everyone should watch this video to see how the US is supposed to be.The video is a rah rah rah for America...not much else.

Right now, our social security payments are goign right to the retired. That's fucked up. If it's there at all, that's not how the system was designed to work, and now we are digging ourselves into deeper and deeper debt.  You think 9.4 trillion is bad??? HAHAHAHAH... we've seen NOTHING YET.  Thank the lefties for the "Unified Budget Act" for that one... leftist policies FTL.

I think there are so many lefties here because the vast majority of them are seriouslyÂ fiscally ignorant.  There has been SOME progress, though... literally within the last month they FINALLY enabled a free market system for car insurance. Before the whole system was absolutely HORRENDOUS. No lie, after Geico, Progressive, Allstate etc were allowed in, and government-regulated price fixing was abolished... I switched to Progressive and am saving (no lie) 1300 bucks a year.  Then again, Romney (a SUPPOSED conservative - BS if you ask me), uses leftist policies like FORCING everyone to get health insurance, otherwise you have to pay 200-900 dollars in additional state taxes when tax time comes around. He makes me sick. I always have health insurance, but that policy I find especially disgusting.

0 hmmm...who will it be...michael bloomberg? jeb bush?  i still don't think mccain has a shot in hell of making it to the nomination and/or the election.  Damn I'm glad that you don't get to vote here. He already has the Nomination.  Not to mention his name is next on the list to be President...  Sure, thats what the MSM wants you to believe...This thread has sparked much deep thought in me. Like:  1) The lobbyist - is she hot?  2) Maybe they can double date with Obama and his gay-male-crackwhore buddy.  3) The older I get, the more I despise the US Education system. If I had learned what politics was really like in social studies, I would have been a politician. Those guys get more ass than a toilet seat.     Excuse me for being ignorant to the facts, but what is "the MSM?"Really not all that different from his wife lol     (Main Stream Media)  that was sarcasm, BTW  He just lost my vote.  dammit!

0    Agreed. I really don't have anything negative to say about either movie. DC/Warner Bros. really needs to give the reboot treatment to Superman like they did with Batman.  I...  I like the old Batman movies.Superman (the original series)  I pick that because for its time, men... it had pretty good graphics.Batman-great Batman Returns-good, though there was some cheesy moments in the movie. Batman Forever-I liked it, though Two-Face should have done more then yelling about how the Bat won't die. Batman and Robin-total piece of crapBatman begins far surpassed iron man on every level.  Agreed! I am hoping the same for the Dark Knight.. its my most anticipated movie for this year.. I love what bale, Nolan and the rest have done with the batman universe.I can't imagine anything less than spectacular from them for this movie. i will be seeing it at midnight o the day it comes out and then in imax on the weekend.i think we should fly to nolan's house in england and make him show it to us now.me too man.. me too.. or anything that comes close to that strategy. Gotta see it as soon as possible .. and as much as possible..Already ready your weapons. We're going to sail over there.

I love what bale, Nolan and the rest have done with the batman universe.I can't imagine anything less than spectacular from them for this movie. i will be seeing it at midnight o the day it comes out and then in imax on the weekend.i think we should fly to nolan's house in england and make him show it to us now.me too man.. me too.. or anything that comes close to that strategy. Gotta see it as soon as possible .. and as much as possible..Already ready your weapons. We're going to sail over there.that's a good idea. that way when we finally get there it'll be ready to open anyway.  we can use my ship.  yea I figure then we wont actually have to hit nolan. Wait will all three of us fit in that? We may have to lighten the load.well, we're gonna need food. how attached are you to peter?Batman Begins.Not at all. He's totally expendable.

0 So it looks like Hillary will have to rely on Obama being assassinated in order to become president.YES!Which is why she shouldn't be on the ticket. Finally it's over.I'm just glad that the Democrates actaully have a nominee now. And I'm glad it's Obama. Now the next thing that needs to happen is for him to become President. We don't need McCain. He is the biggest joke ever.Amazing! Wow!  We're just months away from having a black president, never thought I'd see it in my lifetime!really sad that the delegates chose the wrong democrat.  sad day indeed.  The American people chose Obama. And don't come here giving me that "Hillary had the popular vote" bullshit. The only reason she had slightly more popular votes then Obama was because his name wasn't on the ballot in Michigan when hers was. lol@Clinton and her dumb supporters wanting those votes to count.Actually, It was Obama who pulled his name from the Michigan ballot, so that's his problem for not getting the count in that state. Michigan just did what he asked. Its his fault for pulling his name.  This is why election reform needs to be done. do what the republicans do, just get the votes and be done with it. none of this "delegates" and "super delegates" bull.Also to add, if Clinton does vie for the VP position, then that will be a better choice for the Democrats; Obama needs to stop being a pussy when it comes to illegal immigration.It's time for a change. Plus it's not like Obama is going to be a bad President, I would have been fine with Clinton. It's McCain we have to worry about. If he become President we are in a world of shit. Obama is going to be a great President. Time will prove that.
0 YES!Which is why she shouldn't be on the ticket. Finally it's over.I'm just glad that the Democrates actaully have a nominee now. And I'm glad it's Obama. Now the next thing that needs to happen is for him to become President. We don't need McCain. He is the biggest joke ever.Amazing! Wow!  We're just months away from having a black president, never thought I'd see it in my lifetime!really sad that the delegates chose the wrong democrat.  sad day indeed.  The American people chose Obama. And don't come here giving me that "Hillary had the popular vote" bullshit.

There was no point to leave the names on the ballots since the states were stripped of all its delegates to the national convention for breaking party rules by moving its primary to before February 5.

What do you think is gonna happen with the immigration issue? Do you think 12-15 million illegals are gonna be deported? There's no way thats gonna happen. Mass deportations are out of the picture so its time to look at comprehensive immigration reform.

0 I'll have to agree, my use of the term "useless" was a very poor choice of words.Â  In the final analysis, as politically "ineffective" as they are, at least "AI" and "HRW" represent what appears to be as the last vestige of a united world-wide morality.It probably means that as a sovereign nation, the US doesn't have to submit to someone elses new world order; especially when it sets itself against the interests of this sovereign nation.  After all, these organizations are cheap and shoddy, and lacking gravitas.  You know, kind of like the U.N. only worse.Good to hear this. The Human Rights Council is a sham. They can't seem to decide if the situation in Darfur is genocide, but they are certainly quick to condemn Denmark for thought-crime violations for the Muhammed cartoons. That's why the Bush administration decided to "go it alone" in Iraq, instead of sitting around with the lazy asses aka the UN "Security" Council.  If those guys had brains, they'd take em' out and play with em'.China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia are in the Human Wrongs Council.  That tells me nothing right there. Except that there should be a sitcom about it.the US is illegally holding thousands of "suspected terrorists" in secret foreign prisons and in the holds of about 15 to 17 US military sea vessels. Bush and Cheney are war criminals. They came into office with the idea of conquering the middle east and handing over all the oil rights to multinational oil corporations and destroy anyone who'd get in their way. The US right now is the biggest threat in the world to human rights.  better to be just war criminals than to be war criminals and hypocrits also??  they did the right thing...if they don't plan on honoring all these past treaties and such, they need to just pull out of them... hopefully an administration in the future will work to restore all the damage this administration has done.  It's called common decency. No need to attach "We are the world" to it. But is something we do not possess anymore.Thats what your taught in berkeley huh. Maybe one day you will get your wish and those poor "suspected terrorists" will be allowed to freely walk the streets of America. After all it would be the just thing to do after "illegally" holding them against there will. Maybe we can give them a nice big house and a million dollars too. Perhaps a wall, like the Vietnam Memorial, where we can put the names of those terrorists who died "fighting the biggest threat in the world to human rights"

The nation's capital is setting checkpoints to curb crime, "patriots" suggest we shoot illegals on site, our law enforcement is just as corrupt as it is in Mexico, a 78 yr old man gets hit by a car and people just stand around and look, no one runs to help..etc etc. We have become worse then the terrorists we are supposedly fighting in the middle east.

The nation's capital is setting checkpoints to curb crime, "patriots" suggest we shoot illegals on site, our law enforcement is just as corrupt as it is in Mexico, a 78 yr old man gets hit by a car and people just stand around and look, no one runs to help..etc etc. We have become worse then the terrorists we are supposedly fighting in the middle east.  I know.....Check Points. Don't people even realize that comes from Nazi Germany? What does that say about America? Anyway I heard they are going to be doing drug check points around these summer concerts that come up every year starting this summer. Man!

(rim shot)Overrated put some meat on her. Plus she's got tatto's of her mans name on her not to smart either...  If she had a few more pounds on her, she would be something.  No ass = serious loss of points!   Megan Fox is sooo hot!! She's been named the most beautiful woman alive by FHM. Megan hired a personal trainer that comes to her three times a week. An article at  Project Weight Loss says she's lazy and hates to workout.  uh-oh, you know what that means...give her 10 yrs. and...I hear she has a foot for a hand.

0 memento is a awesome one u should check out  mullholland drive very weird and stylized but found it to be awesome also  donnie darko jus cus people should see that film  12 monkeys brad pitts performance is epic  seven david fincher at his best  crash (james spader) its a very haunting film that i found very good.... might like/some dont :/Dressed to Kill (or any DePalma).American Psycho  Play Misty for Me  Memento  The Usual Suspects  Se7en  Rear Window  Silence of the LambsAlmost anything by David Lynch. You can't really go wrong. Stuff like Blue Velvet, Mullholland Drive, Eraserhead, Wild At Heart, Lost Highway, Inland Empire. Look him up.Three more that came to mind....  The original Norweigan Insomnia  The original Dutch version of the Vanishing  Michael Haneke's Cache. Fantastic psychological thriller. If you're looking for challenging, than this is the movie for you.  I'd recommend a couple of Hammer's little-known (or at least rarely mentioned) black and white suspense films, "Nightmare" and "Paranoiac".The Game  with Micheal Douglass and Sean Penn1.Cannibal Holocaust The film was banned in countless countries, and Deodato actually had to show evidence, in court, that the film was indeed fake, even going so far as to bring the actors on a popular TV talk show in Italy to prove they were still alive.  2. Men Behind the Sun To be honest, this film could be 100% fictional and it still would have made the top 10 list, as some of the scenes are downright brutal and extremely controversial: a (supposedly real) live cat is thrown into a room of starving rats and torn to pieces; a (supposedly real) corpse of a boy is slowly autopsied; a man is placed in a pressure chamber until his intestines blow out of his anus; a woman is tied to a post outside in the freezing cold, with buckets of cold water being dumped over her head to test the effects of frostbite, then her hands are plunged into boiling hot water, the skin peeling right off the bones; etc etc  3.Guinea Pig: Flower of Flesh and Blood The film itself is fairly simple: a creepy Japanese dude in a samurai suit (donât ask us) kidnaps a girl, drugs her, ties her to a bed, and slowly cuts her to pieces. Thatâs it, thatâs the whole movie. But the special effects are SO well done and so convincing, it really takes it to a whole other level. Fingers, hands, you name it; everything is cut off in slow, agonizing detail. The blood looks great, the gore is splendid, and the dismemberments are top notch (for example, after cutting off one of her hands, the fingers suddenly clench around his wrist, despite the fact it is no longer attached. Yikes.). 4. Cutting Moments Cutting Moments is a disquieting, harrowing look at the mental breakdown and subsequent downward spiral of a family torn apart by abuse, both physical and mental, and the limits of the human psyche. A mostly silent and slow-paced film, thereâs no denying the talent behind Cutting Moments, as Buck masterfully lets silence speak louder then words; allowing the tension of the film to slowly rise to a boil before the incredibly disturbing and permanently scarring bloody climax.  5. Aftermath Aftermath pushes the boundaries of the genre in ways few films even dream of. Nacho Cerda made the film as part of a trilogy, focusing on death, post-death, and rebirth. Aftermath (the 2nd film in the trilogy) shows how we are all at the mercy of others once we die; our bodies nothing more then husks of meat to be poked, prodded, and disassembled.  DARE TO SEE THOSE MOVIE? MAIL ME IF U WANT THOSE MOVIE.  i watched DD for the first time yesterday. i wasn't impressed. it was ok but i don't understand the cult following that it has...Seven was good Color of Night Copycat

0 American Psycho  Play Misty for Me  Memento  The Usual Suspects  Se7en  Rear Window  Silence of the LambsAlmost anything by David Lynch. You can't really go wrong. Stuff like Blue Velvet, Mullholland Drive, Eraserhead, Wild At Heart, Lost Highway, Inland Empire. Look him up.Three more that came to mind....  The original Norweigan Insomnia  The original Dutch version of the Vanishing  Michael Haneke's Cache. Fantastic psychological thriller. If you're looking for challenging, than this is the movie for you.  I'd recommend a couple of Hammer's little-known (or at least rarely mentioned) black and white suspense films, "Nightmare" and "Paranoiac".The Game  with Micheal Douglass and Sean Penn1.Cannibal Holocaust The film was banned in countless countries, and Deodato actually had to show evidence, in court, that the film was indeed fake, even going so far as to bring the actors on a popular TV talk show in Italy to prove they were still alive.  2. Men Behind the Sun To be honest, this film could be 100% fictional and it still would have made the top 10 list, as some of the scenes are downright brutal and extremely controversial: a (supposedly real) live cat is thrown into a room of starving rats and torn to pieces; a (supposedly real) corpse of a boy is slowly autopsied; a man is placed in a pressure chamber until his intestines blow out of his anus; a woman is tied to a post outside in the freezing cold, with buckets of cold water being dumped over her head to test the effects of frostbite, then her hands are plunged into boiling hot water, the skin peeling right off the bones; etc etc  3.Guinea Pig: Flower of Flesh and Blood The film itself is fairly simple: a creepy Japanese dude in a samurai suit (donât ask us) kidnaps a girl, drugs her, ties her to a bed, and slowly cuts her to pieces. Thatâs it, thatâs the whole movie. But the special effects are SO well done and so convincing, it really takes it to a whole other level. Fingers, hands, you name it; everything is cut off in slow, agonizing detail. The blood looks great, the gore is splendid, and the dismemberments are top notch (for example, after cutting off one of her hands, the fingers suddenly clench around his wrist, despite the fact it is no longer attached. Yikes.). 4. Cutting Moments Cutting Moments is a disquieting, harrowing look at the mental breakdown and subsequent downward spiral of a family torn apart by abuse, both physical and mental, and the limits of the human psyche. A mostly silent and slow-paced film, thereâs no denying the talent behind Cutting Moments, as Buck masterfully lets silence speak louder then words; allowing the tension of the film to slowly rise to a boil before the incredibly disturbing and permanently scarring bloody climax.  5. Aftermath Aftermath pushes the boundaries of the genre in ways few films even dream of. Nacho Cerda made the film as part of a trilogy, focusing on death, post-death, and rebirth.

0 unfortunatly everything that is adapted into a movie has alot missing theres threads on x-men,hulk etc. what i will give bay credit for is that he kept the movie with a real sense of aww, watching them transform was very incredible even though they were different very aesthetically pleasing and fun..it was a fun movie to watch and i enjoyedI do like Bay's style when it comes to action. The transformation scenes made me a little dizzy, they were too close up at times. But he does have a knack for action.I forgot to add, that I hope they fix all these problems in part 2.I hate EVERYTHING about that fucking movie.  It ruined Transformers for me.I was never a Transformers fan, and I still hated the movie.the cgi action in the movie rocked me. michael bay will always suck but thats what people are into. damn, optimus was really gay for humans. he was "ill die for you guys!".I'm sure the next movie will expand on Starscream's personality.  If not, too bad.I still think that Michael Bay focused on the humans more than the Transformers.  It was almost as if the robots were just thrown in as eye candy.i liked the transformers movie..loved it in fact and i literally grew up on the transformers. i thought it told a good story and the action was tight my only complaint is the transformations looked too complicated..there was too many parts n shit movin for me..i think if they had kept the transforming a little closer to the cartoon it would have been perfect..another complaint i have is megatron n starscream was fuckin ugly..they could have made starscream look a little like he did in the cartoon at least and megatron was just plain ass ugly if he comes back in part 2 or 3 maybe they will have him actually scan a jet or somethin to turn into like the rest of em didALL HAIL TO THE MIGHTY STARSCREAM!!!!!!

In Generation 1 the balance was perfect. A lot of fans my age say that the saturation of too many new Transformers ruined Generation 1 and made it get cancelled. I don't think so. I think it was the saturation of Daniel being used too much, too many times when the parents were the focus of attention, then they did what Star Trek and Return Of The Jedi made mistakes with, they brought in too many different alien species, which has the same effect as too many humans. The attention was taken away from the Transformers.

What really ruined The Transformers movie is the fact that Michael Bay is not a fan of the transformers, and he stated he did'nt want to make a cartoon of the Transformers, The Transformations were to complex, the transformations of the Transformers from past shows were never complex, they were promoting stuff that took away space for putting more information in the script ( Like Mountain Dew, X-Box, ect. ), They had one of the Original voice actors ( Optimus Prime ( AKA Petter Cullen ), and not the other ( Frank Welker ( AKA Megatron ), Way tomany quotes slaming the original series, Not having Bumblebee a VW bug, and yet having a VW bug in the movie!, none of the desgins looked anything near the original desgins of the Transformers, Not having the Matrix Of Leadership, and instead we get some stupid cube ( Hey was'nt the cube in one of the later Transformers shows ), Bay and Hasbro TRANSFORMED this movie in to a pile of crap! ( Anyone feel free to add the transfomation sound effect! ), the whole witwikey background story, and the selling of his gradfathers glasses could have been deleted, and something better put in, I only payed $2.00 to see Transformers, and to be frank it's not even worth $2.00, that would be an insult to the movies that deserve the admition price of $2.00 LOL!
0    Exactly, look at all the CRAPPY movies made from DC characters. I'm hating this JLA movie already and it's not even out yet.   and that's EXACTLY what ruined all the past Transformer franchieses. Too much focus on humans, especially annoying little kids.  In Generation 1 the balance was perfect. A lot of fans my age say that the saturation of too many new Transformers ruined Generation 1 and made it get cancelled. I don't think so. I think it was the saturation of Daniel being used too much, too many times when the parents were the focus of attention, then they did what Star Trek and Return Of The Jedi made mistakes with, they brought in too many different alien species, which has the same effect as too many humans. The attention was taken away from the Transformers.I'm not excited for number 2. The 1st was so disappointing.   Well Mr. Allen, I can't really disagree with you. I'm a TF Fanboy myself. I think I feel a bit of excitement, but that could be anxiety and worry over how bad it might be ruined even more. Instead of a magical cube that they all sprouted up from, they might create some other magical ooze that the cube sprang from without any answers to any questions.I just read that have told Megan Fox to Gain 10 Pounds for Transformers Sequel.where at?

0 Gas prices in Ontario dropped from 1.38/l to 1.274/l over the last month. They are now back up to about 1.345/l. That works out to about U.S. $6.00/gal.Of course, gas prices goes down when I can't drive my car...damned broken foot. Happy Califrnia your gas have been to high already in Kentucky they,ve gone up 20 cents in past 2 weeks but we are still only at $4.04 a gallon.  Maybe everything is just evening out, then. A few weeks ago I paid $4.79 a gallon at the gas station by my house and yesterday I paid $4.53 a gallon at the same place. And I noticed at some places downtown it was even ten cents cheaper.Who knows, but I do find more and more people standing at the gas pump curseing with me as they fill their vehicles.world demand for expensive gasoline has decreased  if demand reamains low, prices will dropThanks for that nugget of brilliance Dujac. To expound and make a predictive statement on that, Chinese subsidies and such are due to drop significantly after the Olympics. So, you should probably see a quick jump up in oil during the Olympics, and then a drop that will continue as world demand stays low.I know why. There's a presidential election coming up. Bush lifts the off shore drilling ban and prices fall a bit. Makes republicans look good. The oil companies need another Republican president so they can continue raping your wallets. Don't fall for it. And don't worry, gas prices haven't topped off. Not by a long shot. If you think the oil companies are seeking a Republican President in the house this next election you are absolutely correct. If a Democrat happens to step in to the roll of President the price of fuel will increase. A Democratic President will raise taxes on fuel, making prices sky rocket.  You think prices are hitting you bank account hard now, just wait and see what will happen if a Democrat takes over as commander and chief. You think filling your car now is expensive, just watch and see.. You may be shocked at the outcome.Gas prices did go down. Or better said, the gas guzzlers went down south... of the border.   The US and Mexican press had a field day sensationalizing the events for several months, which in turn greatly affected tourism and Bajaâs economy as over 40 percent of the Baja coastal region depends on tourism. Baja has experienced the economic pain that also punctuates for them the great binational economic interdependence.  Now it seems that despite the media fervor in reporting and sensationalizing Mexicoâs problems with drug capos, Americans are flocking back to Baja. Why?  Saving money, trumps fear. Gasoline prices now over $4.50 a gallon in San Diego is available anywhere in Baja for around $2.55 a gallon. And the stampede of US trucks buying diesel fuel at $2.20 a gallon versus over $5 a gallon in San Diego, has caught Baja shorthanded an unable to keep up with the demand. Once again the economic interdependence is evident.  Robert Kline from Orange County waiting to fuel up his Ford pickup said that once he began reading and seen on nightly news about all the cars crossing for gas, he figured things canât be that bad, so he decided to come back to Baja that was his favorite weekend retreat. Like Kline, others are beginning to see that things are OK, and they too will begin to travel to Baja. So things will go back to normal during the summer months.  http://hispanicvista.com/HVC/Columnist/posiojr/070608Patrick_Osi o.htm  BTW Mexico's gas prices go up only by inflation rate, where here in the US they are set by the individual sellers (companies).

So things will go back to normal during the summer months.  http://hispanicvista.com/HVC/Columnist/posiojr/070608Patrick_Osi o.htm  BTW Mexico's gas prices go up only by inflation rate, where here in the US they are set by the individual sellers (companies).  it's called the 'law of supply and demand'  something that few seem to acknowledge   Try your left foot.yeah it is a fluctuation but the fluctuations will probably result in the gas going down... I am not kidding you, they might be drilling right now and we need people to drill.  whoa that is expensive  yeah the had pretty much topped off in my own opinion... I don't see it going any higher so that is good news.  Again, the knowledge you impart on us peons goes far too unappreciated.  you're a peon? Relatively speaking.
0  If you think the oil companies are seeking a Republican President in the house this next election you are absolutely correct. If a Democrat happens to step in to the roll of President the price of fuel will increase. A Democratic President will raise taxes on fuel, making prices sky rocket.  You think prices are hitting you bank account hard now, just wait and see what will happen if a Democrat takes over as commander and chief. You think filling your car now is expensive, just watch and see.. You may be shocked at the outcome.Gas prices did go down. Or better said, the gas guzzlers went down south... of the border.   The US and Mexican press had a field day sensationalizing the events for several months, which in turn greatly affected tourism and Bajaâs economy as over 40 percent of the Baja coastal region depends on tourism. Baja has experienced the economic pain that also punctuates for them the great binational economic interdependence.  Now it seems that despite the media fervor in reporting and sensationalizing Mexicoâs problems with drug capos, Americans are flocking back to Baja. Why?  Saving money, trumps fear. Gasoline prices now over $4.50 a gallon in San Diego is available anywhere in Baja for around $2.55 a gallon. And the stampede of US trucks buying diesel fuel at $2.20 a gallon versus over $5 a gallon in San Diego, has caught Baja shorthanded an unable to keep up with the demand.

0  gas prices will never go down...just sort of a roller coaster ride up  i don't think you know what you're talking about   wholesale oil prices have come down to some degree  consumer prices are somewhat flexible upward, but strictly  sticky downward; so, gas prices will not fall significantly unless  the decreased demand for it, can be maintained for some time  the last time we had gas prices rise, sales of pickup trucks and suvs fell sharply only to pick up again when prices fell. but most people think we aren't gonna see gas in 2 dollar range ever again. why should they reduce the price? the don't have to and nobody seems to know why they are up so high anyhow.  the reason why, has already been posted in this threadGas prices going DOWN????? Some one should send word via pony express to Long Island.... still paying $4.65 a gallon.... just like last week...   If a Democrat becomes President they will raise taxes, causing the cost of fuel to go up. If you know anything about production, you will then know the Government taxes every gallon a gas purchased at the pumps. The Government makes more money off a gallon of fuel that the oil companies.  If they raise taxes, this will probably include the fuel tax, increasing prices of each gallon you pump into your vehicle.A socialist answer to the global rise in gas prices Yep, it dropped to $3.86 near my house.   Link didn't work for me . . . but here's something I find ironic. I heard on the radio this morning. Ok with all the hype over fossil fuels blah blah blah, and the price of gas, Americans have really cut down on the amount they drive. Which means, that this conservation (which is what the liberals cry that they want, right?) means less gas is purchased. Which means less taxes for the gov't. Which means they now want to think about raising taxes to make up for the loss.  Fucking idiots.

Sales are down. As a result less tax revenue is being generated. Some in our government plan to raise taxes on the remaining businesses in order to make up for the deficit.

0 There is something seriously wrong with the canon of ethics if it means that these two miserable assholes could sit around for 20+ years while an innocent man is in prison. What the fuck was the purpose of their so-called signed affidavit? It fucking sat in a lock box.  Is it any wonder that lawyers top the list of most dispised professions. I hope these two miserable bastards get inundated with hate mail for years to come. That "$omething" is MONEY which means if you are "indigent" be prepared to do time in jail or face the death penalty if you happen to be innocent.

0 But what if you didn't need a lawyer?  Lawyers get paid to tell lies.  Yes, I admit all all lawyers arent jonny cochran, but still. They knowingly portray reality under a false microscope, and sometimes its deadly...Whats wrong with our lawyer's?  There's not any hanging from our trees.  So very true. The language they use is pretty much foreign to probably about 90% of us. Therefore making us equal in the eyes of the law pretty much a out and out lie. Of course ignorance is no excuse, as they say. What gets me is your considered ignorant if your unable to lawyerspeak or speak the tongue of deception.  I've had recent dealings needing a lawyer, That son o bitch ripped me off more than the people I was after. He's 3g's richer and I'm in the exact same situation I was in before he was retained.  I should have handled it the old Irish way, but on the advice of those closest to me, I refrained.  Heh, Maybe I will send that thiefing som bitch a piece of rope and one of those witty Irish quotes and let him think about that not everyone he screw's is going to let it slide, or maybe one day he will turn around and there I'll be, to explain to him about honesty and integrity and when someone charges $300.00 bucks an hour, he damn well better earn it.Lawyers are the biggest scumbags to live on this planet, all they care about is there F---ing money They dont care if you go to prison. Why do yuu think most of the people in prison are poor, most of them should be in there but it makes you wonder how many innocent people are there just because the scumbag piece of crap didnt get enuogh money to line his pocket! Then the lump of bile when theyve thoroughly screwed there fellow americans out of everything they have, They somehow think that they are now worthy of representing us as Senetor or Congressman. We dont really even get a choice because chances are both sides of the race are going to be scumbag bile. So thats why we end up with a Congress that has the the worst approvel rating in american history. Most scumbag Lawyers think they are so supperior to the average american that they have no Idea what issues are most important to the people they are supposed to be representing. But they do know how to spend tax money that doesnt belong to them did I mention I hate Lawyers!!!! I heard of one "public defender" even showing up DRUNK for a trial! He was do drunk that the judge had to suspend proceedings. Really wonder why these people conduct themselves and treat their indigent clients the way they do. LMAO  Funny thing is we all hate lawyers, till we need one. Yeah, but very FEW can afford one unless you have the wealth and fame of Victor Newman, or Bill Gates! You mean a good lawyer, right?  I got my older brother. He's an attorney. Although it would have to deal with real estate. Otherwise, I'm fucked.

In general, ÃÂ I completely disagree. ÃÂ Yes, there are those who are new and doing it for the experience, and there are those who are doing it because they have to and really donÃ¢â¬â¢t care because they are getting far less for representing someone under the Public Defenders arrangement that they would from a paying customer.ÃÂ  But there are also those who are doing it because they have a desire to see that everyone is defended. ÃÂ  I was on a murder jury where the defendant was defended by the Public Defenders office.ÃÂ  These guys threw their hearts and souls into the defense.ÃÂ  Too bad the guy was guilty as hell, but they mounted several appeals after the conviction, interviewed every member of the jury that would talk to them, and I understand that they are still trying to get this dude out.ÃÂ  I contrast that to a lawyer I had, gave him a large retainer, and he withdrew from the case after he had spent it all, much more, and I asked him to put me on a payment plan.

And no, they don't use any Astroglide, either,LMAO!
0  I heard of one "public defender" even showing up DRUNK for a trial! He was do drunk that the judge had to suspend proceedings. Really wonder why these people conduct themselves and treat their indigent clients the way they do. LMAO  Funny thing is we all hate lawyers, till we need one. Yeah, but very FEW can afford one unless you have the wealth and fame of Victor Newman, or Bill Gates! You mean a good lawyer, right?  I got my older brother. He's an attorney. Although it would have to deal with real estate. Otherwise, I'm fucked. That is correct! Say, are you having legal problems at present? Not yet. But as an educator, I keep my fingers crossed. We're too sue-happy. I love when parents threaten to sue you if you fail their kid who never did homework and always ditches class.  In general, ÃÂ I completely disagree.

And no, they don't use any Astroglide, either,LMAO!It's the system that is at fault here. Even if they come forward, there's a good chance it wouldn't have made a difference. Having said that, however, had it been me, I would have went to the judge and DA and told what I know and given up the license. At least, maybe, the verdict could have been overturned. Only maybe, but worth a shot. Even if they didn't give up their client, just said that someone else confessed to the crime. What I don't get is why they didn't do it after their client got convicted. He was done for anyway.

Funny that your bro is a real estate attorney. In my one post about getting screwed over by the one I retained, dealed exclusivly with real estate law. The deception he used to justify his costs was unbelievable, using most of the retainer in phone calls to me "reviewing the facts" over and over again. That scumbag even billed me for creating a bill. By the time he actually contacted the developer most of the retainer was gone and of course he needed more money to continue.  There's some things that most decent people don't do, however seems normal for lawyers to cross that line. There in the same class as a funeral director, acting like they feel for your pain and loss, then turn around and sell you a 1,000 casket for 10 grand, of course at the same time selling you a bill of goods that how your departed would be better respected in the silk lined box with the gold plated hardware.

0 it's your opinion, and you're entitled to it. you're not alone. i have a co worker that feels the same way more or less.I think alot of critics feel obligated to give it good ratings because of Ledgers death. I don't think his death had anything to do with it. The performances of the cast and the execution of the film stands on its own.I highly doubt that IMO, hasn't the publicity of Ledgers death come and gone. I mean all I'm hearing now a days is how he did a great job as The Joker, really I haven't once heard anything about his death.   You said itCheck out this awesome threadTDK was better than Begins...I didn't like begins. But I liked TDK...Because of the acting, but I still don't like the Bale over voice acting as Batman.  If you really didn't like itÂ  . . . then I can respect that, but you will have to do better than Bale's voice as Batman. ItÂ was an established fact (comic book) that Batman spoke with a gravelly typeÂ voice. If you expected it to be cheesy. . Â then why did you go to the theater to see it. I personally only go to the theater to see movies thatÂ I think are going to be goodÂ  . . all the rest I can wait for DVD.  The fact that you started a thread while there is one pinned . . . just to state your disgust with the film makes you an attention whoreÂ  . . . GOOD JOB !!  (also 8.5/10 here)

0 Check out this awesome threadTDK was better than Begins...I didn't like begins. But I liked TDK...Because of the acting, but I still don't like the Bale over voice acting as Batman.  If you really didn't like itÂ  . . . then I can respect that, but you will have to do better than Bale's voice as Batman. ItÂ was an established fact (comic book) that Batman spoke with a gravelly typeÂ voice. If you expected it to be cheesy. . Â then why did you go to the theater to see it.

Most super villains in movies don't have the level of realistic character depth, that Ledger, (along with the amazing writers) brought to the "joker".ÃÂ  Besides... I dare the OP to suggest who IS the greatest villain then, since "the joker isn't" 3)I agree that other films have been storywise on par (and better) than The Dark Knight...

It doesn't matter how awesome you make a super hero movie, the premise is still cheesy.  But I loves the super heroes :)
1 There's a couple of idiots in this thread. I think it's obvious who they are.I really don't get these psycho fanboys attacking everyone who didn't like the damn movie. It's a f***ing Batman movie, grow up!  All your bitching and moaning won't change the fact that the movie was just "OK" and nonething more.  No one deserves an oscar and no new ground was broke.  The f***ing Batmobile was stopped by a stupid rocket launcher! WTF?? ha ha ha!  It was a kids movie written to appeal to the emo generation... I guess that explains all the "boo hoos" and "I'll kill myself if Heath don't get an oscar!"  Some of you REALLY need to get outside more ;)all your bitching and moaning about batman is the same.i had no idea you felt that way. haha...says the guy who hunts down every single TDK thread to post the SAME thing...you need to go out more...and maybe see more movies to talk about...because your rhetoric on this one has grown tiresome... Isn't there a new mask out there somewhere to discover? lmao at this guy feeling left out b/c we've ignored him for a while. Yeah...we should have kept ignoring him...it would drive him crazy in a couple of days yeah b/c if you're on a computer that=inside. welcome to 2008 dude I'm on my laptop @ school, outside. i dont' want anyone saying this movie is cheesy until they see the original with Adam West...

Ledger will win an Oscar because of is untimely death rather than his role and that is actually rather insulting to his memory, in my opinion.  A.

0    I would not put the dark knight in the top 10.  just seen it last night, I was't that thrilled .How does everyone somehow miss the stickied "DARK KNIGHT" thread?The Dark what?What's a Dark Knight? Is this some medieval movie?I saw it. You will not be disappointed. Check out the thread on it on top of this forum. It is pinned at the top for the time being.Actually its what everybody was freaking about in the movie: THE HAPPENINGOriginally, I had doubts as to weather or not this film was going to live up to the hype. But, after seeing it this week, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was arguably one of the best action flicks I had seen in quite some time.  Neither was your date . . . I hear heÂ wished he hadÂ wentÂ and seen it with John C. Reilly!  Blindness?

It's proper forum etiquette. Have you no manners?if you haven't seen the movie why are you kn the dark knight thread? go see the movie and stop your bitching before i tell you the whole movieI have already seen the movie but I have friends on here that have not because they haven't had a chance yet. whats your address. I got you a present. I need to know where to send it.let me make sure to tell all your friends about it. so give me his name  Actually he has 3 friends in the movie forum! lol  Don't argue with C.Allen, he's just a forum troll that likes to play keyboard ninja and go around the forum cussing people out for attention. Just ignore him and maybe he'll go back to masturbating to his "cammed" copy of The dark Knight!I see you have a new profile picture. You must've saved up big time for that vacation. Must be good to not have to use the same old pool this year. ..

Yeah Justin, stop being a fucking forum troll!Batman saves Harvey.....the girlfriend dies.  Two-face falls to his death in the end.  Joker gets arrested.  The boat with the prisoners on it....they throw the detonator out the window...the other boat doesn't have the courage to push it.  He never shows his true identity....he lets Harvey be a decoy.  The girl chooses Harvey in the note.  The Joker kills the asian guy by burning him on top of a stack of money.  Oh...and in the prison...the guy with the stomach ache has a bomb inside of him...   AND THEN BATMAN HUNG HIMSELF (too much stupid fan fare)   I thought he took pills or did he do both just to make sure he passed on  whoops that was ledger.  That's absolute gold! Gold I tell you!What TV show was she in?can't you just hear him/her saying in a deep, raspy voice, "hey girls, who wants margaritas?"  What he looked liked before plastic surgeryBUMP

1 Where did find that info on the boston tea party, makes the whole thing a lot less patriotic.   Also, shut up Dave, you're an idiot. lol stupidity reigns in this thread.ALL countries have their stupid apples... AND their rotten apples..Well, as others have already said, it was at a bar and it is quite silly to judge an entire nation solely on your experience there. It isn't valid evidence for what you are arguing.  However... I do believe that Americans, whilst not being inherently less intelligent, are, on average, more ignorant than other nationalities about the world around them. Why? Americans grow up without many "outside" influences in the media - I would say that 98 percent of your television and film content is American made, american produced, directed, acted..... most of the music that gets commercial airplay in the states are also very much american dominated. Also, geographically, america is quite isolated, really.... sure, britain is an island, but it's only a hop skip and a jump to about 20 different countries... True, It's not fair to call them stupid, but ignorant would be the right wordjust because im from London i have never met the queen or the the Spice girls!!! Well looks like someone won this argument. Why is it exaggerated? I don't think saying 98 percent of America's film and television content is American...      Sorry, i'm an idiot, i read that wrong. I'll start over. Yes, you're right

I'll start over. Yes, you're right  Lol, okay. =pIf you ever want to sell that honda, get ahold of me.. great cars.lol lol.. actually, as far as 'fat yank'/James Bond guy.. The Brits are catching up to Americans in Weight gain, according to recent polls. And WE get asked by Brits 'so, where are the cowboys? Isn't the wild wild west still all wilderness?Doesn't everyone in Texas wear a cowboy hat?' (and I am originally from the North Coast, near New York, only recent transplant to TX, so I am much 'closer' to the big pond, originally.. hmm.. think I'll go back to England)lol amusing.

To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.   haha That's exactly what I wanted to post but got too lazy to look up the exact quote.Life is a cereal that gets soggy in milk.  
0 The South is the only part that benefits from North Sea oil. GTFO!It's going to get a whole lot worse when Scotland gets independence and takes control of it's oil.   Well i hope Scotlands oil is actually secured in the constitutional settlement. Alex Salmond has already conceded that the fucking royals will still be Scotlands head of state after independence. Who knows what other concessions that twat might end up making.After the referendum that can be changed. I want a republic and i don't think sending William to St Andrews constitutes a claim on Scottish sovereignty post independence!  Now, from my limited knowledge of internet chat terms, I gather that "GTFO" stands quite simply for "Get The Fuck Off".  Am I right?  Answer came there none.Wrong. It's "Get The Fuck Out", not "Get The Fuck Off".

We may benefit from Scottish oil but they benefit from our taxes.

The South East might be the wealthiest part of the country, however it also pays most tax per head and spends less per head in public spending.

I'm guessing that the southeast financially speaking is wealthier than the northern parts. It is fashionable for wealthy people to donate to charities. It is possible that whatever taxes they have less of in comparison with the other parts are compensated for by people donated to various charities such as privately funded soup kitchens and other things of that nature. Now in saying all that I said I was not implying that all public services are necessarily necessary and in writing what was just written previously in this sentence I was not saying whether or not I disagree with various public services being funded.

0    i agree,  as for scottish oil, i doubt that they will be able to nationalise the oil, currently the profits get sent in londons direction but there is a lot of scottish financial interest down here so what is being proposed would essentially receive opposition from scottish business who would be loosing out to scottish politics  nevertheless, i believe the main problem is thatÂ the oil may be up there, but we own the technology to properly extract it  southerners get taxed to the hilt in proportion to what we get for our taxes,  whats happening with the credit crunch now is interesting  big business is coming under scrutony because of its corruption, but what the silent majority dont realise is that greedy london business is the only thing keeping this country going at the moment, if the banks flop then we can fall back on our steel works or engineering, we have a global economy and apart from business, britain has nothing of great significance to offer  its said that we are now a service economy but i think that is just a political buzz term for fucc all, in an age of mass outsourcing of our services, i think its a bit of orwellian double think  It's quite amazing how rude some people can be.  My first post said "Discuss" with the title asking a question, not making a statement. If I made a blatant statement then that would warrant your abuse, which is quite easy to dish out considering you've got a computer to hide behind.  I would carry this on but knowing how people behave online you'll most probably either...  1) Make some trashy comment based on insults that can't be backed up.  2) Start twisting my words round so it makes out I've meant something else.  3) Just play dumb and pretend you don't understand what I said even though you did. All because you can't think of a response that doesn't feature the 3 usual responses I've listed here.  It's all predictable.  LOL.  So you know 'LOL', but not 'GTFO'?Or maybe the 4th option which is to change the subject entirely.  Interesting you mention it though. Yep, until now I did know LOL but not GTFO. But then again I know the Spanish for "Hello", but without knowing the whole Spanish language.  I didnt change the subject, i merely gave you 3 other subjects to take exception to.To answer the question... based on the map posted in the thread it's obvious the southeast is not receiving the same percentage of taxes. I'm guessing that the southeast financially speaking is wealthier than the northern parts. It is fashionable for wealthy people to donate to charities. It is possible that whatever taxes they have less of in comparison with the other parts are compensated for by people donated to various charities such as privately funded soup kitchens and other things of that nature. Now in saying all that I said I was not implying that all public services are necessarily necessary and in writing what was just written previously in this sentence I was not saying whether or not I disagree with various public services being funded.  My thought is why did you have to say GTFO. Could you not simply talk to me instead of insult me?  Sheltered background? You really know nothing about me, do you?I think someone should comment on my comment  GTFO is still telling people where to go which is pretty disrespectful.

A bit late in the day but you're right, you will get flayed for this.  This is the argument that Kelvin McKenzie tried to use when doing a bit of Jock bashing on quesiton time.  However, the true figures that came about later showed that out of the UK Scotland was the only part that received what it gave, ie we are self sufficient, if you include the revenues from Scottish gas and oil which at present has been subsidising the rest of the UK since the 70s.  Scotland says it pays its way and does not need English taxes Â· Analysis assigns all North Sea revenues to Edinburgh Â· Spendthrift claims based on 'myths and mistakes'  James Meikle The Guardian, Saturday November 3 2007 Article history Scotland pays its own way despite its depiction as a spendthrift nation abusing the generosity of English taxpayers, according to a new analysis of government spending. And far from receiving an unfair proportion of the tax pot, the breakdown shows that Scotland gets less public spending per head than Northern Ireland or London. Tax revenues from Scotland almost match the country's Â£49.2bn a year public spending - although only if all North Sea oil and gas revenues are attributed to Edinburgh, a controversial allocation.  The research, published yesterday by the Glasgow Herald, is based on Treasury figures in Whitehall, an analysis by consultants Oxford Economics and the newspaper's own calculations.  Tired of the clamour from English politicians and the London-based media for Gordon Brown to rein in the Scottish executive's spending, the paper said much of the "mischief" was based on a series of myths, mistakes and misconceptions.  David Cameron has signalled that he would review the Treasury system for sharing government funds across the country, adding that people should not think "there was some magic pot of gold" in England. Former Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie also attacked "our tartan chums" for taking the "clever wealth-creators" of England for granted.  Critics say that Scots receive Â£1,500 a head more than people living in England, but the new analysis suggests the truth is more complicated. Despite its pockets of deprivation - one-third of the UK's landmass and far-flung communities are in Scotland - the average Â£9,631 public spending per head is less than London's Â£9,748 or Northern Ireland's Â£10,271. While cities such as Glasgow receive high levels of incapacity benefit, the overall welfare bill per head, Â£3,086, is lower in Scotland than in large parts of northern England.  The tax take from Scotland is only outranked by London, illustrating how Scots and their businesses are making their contribution to UK coffers, the report said. Not only did the North Sea bonanza swell Britain's public purse, but the nation's heavy smokers, though banned from smoking in public places before the rest of Britain, swelled the tobacco duty contributions disproportionately, contributing more than Â£1bn a year out of a UK Â£8bn.  Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said: "This destroys the myth that Scotland is anything other than a resource-rich nation, well capable of flourishing with independence. Of course, the myth of the subsidised Scot has been peddled not just by Westminster Tories and the English tabloids , but also by politicians in Scotland for their own partisan ends."  The Herald's senior commentator, Alf Young, said the picture was far more nuanced than the black and white certainties of London-based tabloids. "Scotland is not some subsidy-obsessed outrider of the British state, offering little in return by way of tax revenues. There are other parts of the UK which receive higher per capita allocations of public expenditure."

David Cameron has signalled that he would review the Treasury system for sharing government funds across the country, adding that people should not think "there was some magic pot of gold" in England. Former Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie also attacked "our tartan chums" for taking the "clever wealth-creators" of England for granted.  Critics say that Scots receive Â£1,500 a head more than people living in England, but the new analysis suggests the truth is more complicated. Despite its pockets of deprivation - one-third of the UK's landmass and far-flung communities are in Scotland - the average Â£9,631 public spending per head is less than London's Â£9,748 or Northern Ireland's Â£10,271. While cities such as Glasgow receive high levels of incapacity benefit, the overall welfare bill per head, Â£3,086, is lower in Scotland than in large parts of northern England.  The tax take from Scotland is only outranked by London, illustrating how Scots and their businesses are making their contribution to UK coffers, the report said. Not only did the North Sea bonanza swell Britain's public purse, but the nation's heavy smokers, though banned from smoking in public places before the rest of Britain, swelled the tobacco duty contributions disproportionately, contributing more than Â£1bn a year out of a UK Â£8bn.  Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said: "This destroys the myth that Scotland is anything other than a resource-rich nation, well capable of flourishing with independence. Of course, the myth of the subsidised Scot has been peddled not just by Westminster Tories and the English tabloids , but also by politicians in Scotland for their own partisan ends."  The Herald's senior commentator, Alf Young, said the picture was far more nuanced than the black and white certainties of London-based tabloids. "Scotland is not some subsidy-obsessed outrider of the British state, offering little in return by way of tax revenues. There are other parts of the UK which receive higher per capita allocations of public expenditure."  I'll refer you to my explanation. taxation has been a bit murky in the UK with whitehall for decades fleecing Scotland whilst perpetrating the myth that Scotland scrounges off the rich south.Hi, Swim,fish,swim.  What are your thoughts on English students being forced into debt because your ministers voted that we should pay their students tuition fees?  You say that, but did you leave it at that?  Nah, they whiney little bitch sent me a private message letting me know how much of a prat i was, and that my opinion means nothing to him(which is obviously true, because ofcourse, when youre so unaffected by someone, you have to send them angry message letting them know), and all that was before he mentioned that it would be extremely childish of me to reveal all this in the forums.

0   My thought is why did you have to say GTFO. Could you not simply talk to me instead of insult me?  Sheltered background? You really know nothing about me, do you?I think someone should comment on my comment  GTFO is still telling people where to go which is pretty disrespectful.  Are you 12?To be honest, I can't be bothered having a row with someone I've never met.  If I think telling someone to GTFO is rude then it's hardly a surprise if I find it rude when someone says it to me. I don't care if you don't think it's rude.  I'm gonna leave it at that.  A bit late in the day but you're right, you will get flayed for this.  This is the argument that Kelvin McKenzie tried to use when doing a bit of Jock bashing on quesiton time.  However, the true figures that came about later showed that out of the UK Scotland was the only part that received what it gave, ie we are self sufficient, if you include the revenues from Scottish gas and oil which at present has been subsidising the rest of the UK since the 70s.  Scotland says it pays its way and does not need English taxes Â· Analysis assigns all North Sea revenues to Edinburgh Â· Spendthrift claims based on 'myths and mistakes'  James Meikle The Guardian, Saturday November 3 2007 Article history Scotland pays its own way despite its depiction as a spendthrift nation abusing the generosity of English taxpayers, according to a new analysis of government spending. And far from receiving an unfair proportion of the tax pot, the breakdown shows that Scotland gets less public spending per head than Northern Ireland or London. Tax revenues from Scotland almost match the country's Â£49.2bn a year public spending - although only if all North Sea oil and gas revenues are attributed to Edinburgh, a controversial allocation.

1 There was also unbridled corruption, fraud and scams going on that had NOTHING to do with Fannie and Freddie.  The FBI has arrested more than 400 in the banking industry so far and there are hundreds of investigations of fraud going on right now.  Amazing how this is not common knowledge.Truth hurtsNote: 2006 is the most recent data available from the Federal Reserve BoardIt is also when the subprime mortgage frenzy was beginning to really boom.I have been reading up on the Community Reinvestment Act, have any of you?  Opposite of subprime  CRA-motivated loans tend to be the opposite of subprime loans, most of which were issued by mortgage brokers and mortgage companies and financed by investment banks, none of which were covered by the CRA.  Here's more evidence that you've been hoodwinked. This information was collected by the Center for Responsible Lending:  â¢ The CRA was effective long before the subprime market existed.  â¢ The CRA has been around for three decades and the financial instruments that allowed the subprime mortgage industry to rise and crash came into existence within the past five years.  â¢ Investment banks, not the federal government, had the appetite for risky loans.  The Wall Street-based market for reselling subprime created the demand for riskier loans. Because the debt would be sold into the market and not kept on the lender's books, many lenders did not bother to verify a borrower's income or assess ability to repay the loan.hey freak you're talking to yourself  no one believes you cuz you lie too much oh wow yu read the cra woo i'm impressed your so smart...worship yourself So prove his lies wrong.  I thought you were blaming Bush before.. What's going on with that?  I'm building my case.  So far, you're not denying any of it. LOLRight.  Say I'm a mortgage lender. Just because I make mortgages doesn't mean I keep them on my books. I make the mortgage and then sell that mortgage to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  Both Fannie and Freddie were buying up a ton of private mortgages. Just because they did not create the initial mortgage doesn't mean that they did not eventually own the mortgage.  Mortgage lenders were being unscrupulous but when you know you can make a shitty mortgage, turn around and sell it to Fannie and Freddie, and still make a profit there is a definite moral hazard.  As I've said before Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac facilitated this problem.

I didn't really care what your income was, is, or could be because my profit is coming when I sell the mortgage off.  Essentially, my risk is minimal because it is assumed by Fannie and Freddie. I make easy profits because I do not have to keep bad mortgages on my books.  Subprime lending was at its height from 2004 to 2006 (hint: this was where the problem lies) - at the height of this, 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie and Freddie. Pretty simple math my man. Gotcha. I would like to sit down and talk with a lender who has done that. I would like to know their thought process and see if they really thought they were helping low-income families afford a home or if they knew it would all blow up, but hoping they would be off the ship before the family defaulted.Have you not read what I have been writing.  Just because 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie or Freddie does not mean that Fannie or Freddie did not come to own these loans.  The problem is NOT where the loan originated but the problem IS where the mortgage ended up. These loans were made in the private sector and then came to be owned by Fannie and Freddie.*above post is to Preston  You need to show that they did in order for me to be concerned... I don't jump to conclusions without evidence.
0 Fannie and Freddie held a small percentage of these bad mortgages. You would know that if you read the info provided for you. Question:  Did you lend to people without down payments by issuing ARMS? Why did you do it? Did their income match up to what they could traditionally afford?Ok, I read the whole article. The most I saw was that as of 2006 Fannie and Freddie had gone from holding 56% to 24% of subprime loans. Thats a reduction yes, but in portfolio terms that is still a HUGE amount weighted toward a risky asset.  The bundled mortgage securities that fannie and freddie offer were seen as minimal risk investments and the fact that 24% of there holdings were in the subprime market sounds downright ludicrous to me.

They purchase loans from the private lenders who actually underwrite the loans."  -like I've been saying.  combine that with:  "Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent"  -which i earlier explained is a huge amount of risky debt to hold. Especially if you're bundling all these mortgages together and selling them off as bonds. Fannie and Freddie were whats known as GSE's (government sponsored enterprise). A problem with GSE's is that many investors like AIG, Lehman Brothers, China, banks, etc. view debt issued by GSE's as risk free because they think the government wont allow the debt to default. Essentially, GSE debt ended up being viewed as Treasury debt with higher return and the same risk. Turns out that wasn't the case now all this debt issued by GSE's has questionable value and its making everything go to shit.  In the end it looks like your article was written by somebody who doesn't know how this whole system works.

Do you need proof that Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages and sell them on the secondary market?  Here from Fannie Mae's website, "Fannie Mae operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market.

We fund our mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets."  I can't find an actual figure stating how much of these private sector loans were actually sold to Fannie and Freddie. However, citing that Fannie doesn't make direct home loans to consumers they had to buy their sub prime holdings from somewhere. My guess is the private sector since thats where the mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners reside.

Plus, these two companies didn't have the same transparency of information rules that other private companies were held to. That is a giant risk.  Although the remaining 76% is held privately. That 76% is probably split up between more than one or two organizations. That mitigates risk. Furthermore, when these private companies were pooling the mortgages they wouldn't be able imply that their bonds would be backed by the U.S. government.

They purchase loans from the private lenders who actually underwrite the loans."  -like I've been saying.  combine that with:  "Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent"  -which i earlier explained is a huge amount of risky debt to hold. Especially if you're bundling all these mortgages together and selling them off as bonds. Fannie and Freddie were whats known as GSE's (government sponsored enterprise). A problem with GSE's is that many investors like AIG, Lehman Brothers, China, banks, etc. view debt issued by GSE's as risk free because they think the government wont allow the debt to default. Essentially, GSE debt ended up being viewed as Treasury debt with higher return and the same risk. Turns out that wasn't the case now all this debt issued by GSE's has questionable value and its making everything go to shit.  In the end it looks like your article was written by somebody who doesn't know how this whole system works.  Still waiting....Obviously, you have no idea how the mortgage markets worked. What benefit would it be for Joe Lender to hold on to a loan he knows will go bad? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acting as intermediaries between the lenders and the overall secondary mortgage market facilitated this entire situation.  The article itself says that 24% of Fannie and Freddie's assets were subprime. Percents are ratios. 84% of the total sub prime loans made is not calculated from the same total number that 24% was derived from.  Do you need proof that Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages and sell them on the secondary market?  Here from Fannie Mae's website, "Fannie Mae operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Rather than making home loans directly with consumers, we work with mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners to help ensure they have funds to lend to home buyers at affordable rates. We fund our mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets."  I can't find an actual figure stating how much of these private sector loans were actually sold to Fannie and Freddie. However, citing that Fannie doesn't make direct home loans to consumers they had to buy their sub prime holdings from somewhere. My guess is the private sector since thats where the mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners reside.You've proved nothing. You've made an assumption and jumped to a conclusion without evidence.... and that is all.So you're claiming the secondary mortgage market has nothing to do with this mess?  Fannie and Freddie went from holding half of all subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding only a quarter of them (see the article I posted).  The reason? They were restricted by laws more than private institutions were.  The private institutions dominated the secondary mortgage market.... so, evidently you're confused.Yes, I've cited those figures. Think about it. Thats two giant institutions holding 24% of volatile debt, pooling it with other mortgages, and selling it off as safe with a wink that its backed by the U.S. government. Plus, these two companies didn't have the same transparency of information rules that other private companies were held to. That is a giant risk.  Although the remaining 76% is held privately. That 76% is probably split up between more than one or two organizations. That mitigates risk. Furthermore, when these private companies were pooling the mortgages they wouldn't be able imply that their bonds would be backed by the U.S. government.
0 and Obama is qualified? LMAO Good One!   Obama is qualified. So is Palin. The difference? One has been treated like shit by the media, and the other hasn't.  He he! LOL!  I think she's pretty rad but I'm a conservative. I can see how she might intimidate the castrati though.Obama is qualified. So is Palin. The difference? One has been treated like shit by the media, and the other hasn't.  Maybe you are right...I still can't stand him :)Palin drags down Republican ticket By DAVID LIGHTMAN SarahPalin has become a drag on the Republican presidential ticket, thefirst time in recent political history that a running mate has madesuch a difference. Among many independents and moderate Republicans,she's raised serious questions about John McCain's judgment, become toomuch of a national punch line and reinforced concerns about McCain'sage. "Nice lady, no experience. It's so sad. She's a giganticdrag," said Chris DePino, a Republican consultant based in New Haven,Conn. The Alaska governor does help the ticket somewhat byenergizing hard-core Republicans, but polls suggest that overall "she'shurting John McCain," said Andrew Kohut, the president of the PewResearch Center. In a nationwide survey Oct. 16-19, Pew foundthat 49 percent of respondents had unfavorable views of Palin, while 44percent saw her favorably. A month earlier, 54 percent had seen herfavorably and 32 percent viewed her negatively. Typically,post-election polls find that vice-presidential choices sway about 1percent of voters. This time, Kohut said, "we'll get a much biggernumber." A key reason is that "the Palin choice reflects poorlyon Senator McCain's judgment," said vice presidential expert JoelGoldstein, a professor of law at St. Louis University. Pew foundthat 41 percent of respondents thought McCain showed "poor judgment"overall, while 29 percent said that of Democratic nominee Barack Obama.While McCain's number isn't solely because of his choice of Palin, herselection was a factor. McCain's age is also a reason for voters'concern about Palin. The Arizona senator is 72 and has had fourinstances of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. MayoClinic physicians have posted a detailed explanation of McCain'scondition and treatment on his Web site. The prognosis, they said, was"good." Worries linger, however. "If something happened toMcCain, she would not be qualified to step in and be president," saidAnnette Barron, an independent voter from Altamonte Springs, Fla. Palinalso has hurt herself by becoming largely invisible to the generalpublic, except when she got media attention for starting controversies- such as charging that Obama was "palling around with terrorists" - orfor receiving $150,000 in clothing and accessories from the RepublicanParty. She also unabashedly identifies herself with the party's conservative wing, alienating moderates. "Itreinforced the notion that John McCain cared little about people likeme," said former Maine state Rep. Sherry Huber, a Republican who backedMcCain in the primary but now supports Obama. "She clearly does notshare the values I and other moderate Republicans do." ProminentRepublicans have echoed that idea. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one ofMcCain's closest friends, suggested that Sen. Joseph Lieberman, anindependent Democrat from Connecticut, would have brought independentsto the ticket. Last week, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said thathad McCain picked him, the Republican Party would have had a bettershot at winning his state. Then there's Palin's image problembecause of what vice-presidential expert Timothy Walch called "thealbatross of American comedy." "Every time (comedian) Tina Feyappeared on TV imitating her, it diminished Palin," said Walch, thedirector of the Herbert Hoover presidential library. "For somebodyessentially unknown, she's diminished when she becomes a caricature ofherself." In most election years, Palin would have been afootnote, like controversial vice-presidential choices Spiro Agnew in1968 or Dan Quayle 20 years later. Both were lightly regarded buttriumphed on winning tickets. However, Goldstein, of St. LouisUniversity, noted that in 1968, Richard Nixon was 55, so the prospectof an Agnew presidency seemed dim. In 1988, Quayle ran with George H.W.Bush, who was essentially running for President Reagan's third termagainst unpopular Democrat Michael Dukakis. In 2008, Goldsteinsaid, Obama "has convinced a broad cross-section of the American peoplehe's presidential," so Palin gives swing voters who are warming to theIllinois senator one more reason to move away from McCain. As forPalin's expected appeal to women, Sieglinde Warren, a teachingsupervisor from Poland, Ohio, was a Clinton supporter who now backsObama. Palin and Clinton don't compare, she said, because "Clinton hadsome substance I could relate to." (EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM) Tobe sure, Palin has had some positive impact on the campaign. McCain hadnever been a favorite of strict conservatives, as he challengedRepublican orthodoxy over the years on tax cuts, campaign finance,climate change and other topics. The Republican base loves Palin. "Somany people can relate to her. She really appeals to everydayhousewives, people who go out and hunt, and people who have done greatthings in their life," said Bob Dodge, a retired communicationsengineer in Sarasota, Fla. And don't tell Jennifer Tarman, aBradenton, Fla., medical assistant, that Palin, who's been a governorsince December 2006, isn't qualified. "She's more qualified thanObama," she said. Obama's been a U.S. senator since January 2005, buthas spent most of the past two years campaigning for the White House. Still, the experts and a lot of swing voters agree with Goldstein. "She's made it much more difficult for McCain," he said. ON THE WEB John McCain's medical records: http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainrecords/Ha yea her speeches are written yet three McCain political consultants went on national television complaining that Palin was not giving the responses written for her..damn her for having a mind of her own..do you really believe that people who take chances and make something of themselves should give half of their earnings to the people who take advantage of the government handouts..please explain how that makes any sense..my father is a small business owner.. He worked for 15 years as a draftsman and project manager making just enough to support his three children and wife..He took advantage of the fact that he lives in the greatest country in the world and started his own business..it was only by the grace of god and a few good friends that he made it through the first years of business..His contracting business is now a corporation and he does make over 250k a year..he lives in a three bedroom 1k sq.foot home with his wife and I. pretty average..yet he pays %40 of what he makes in one year to the government to support the nigger sitting on the street with her three children on welfare..yea i guess you think thats "american"I think the news media is pushing Obama because they remember how many news papers sold during the Clinton Years...oh yea..please list Obama's accomplishments and level of experience..then research Palin and do the same..Its prettyt sad to think our candidate for vice president has more experience than your presidential candidate.. Well at least you tried; it is sad that individuals post about someoneâs experience and forget the candidate they are voting for has less.    Really?   Obama: Running local community projects.  12 years of State/National political experience.    Palin: 10 years city experience. 2 years state experience.     I guess if running a small city is now more important than passing state legislation...

The source said it was probably the "hardest" to get her "up to speed than any candidate in history."  Read more about it @ http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/27/palin.tension/index.html

1 Palin drags down Republican ticket By DAVID LIGHTMAN SarahPalin has become a drag on the Republican presidential ticket, thefirst time in recent political history that a running mate has madesuch a difference. Among many independents and moderate Republicans,she's raised serious questions about John McCain's judgment, become toomuch of a national punch line and reinforced concerns about McCain'sage. "Nice lady, no experience. It's so sad. She's a giganticdrag," said Chris DePino, a Republican consultant based in New Haven,Conn. The Alaska governor does help the ticket somewhat byenergizing hard-core Republicans, but polls suggest that overall "she'shurting John McCain," said Andrew Kohut, the president of the PewResearch Center. In a nationwide survey Oct. 16-19, Pew foundthat 49 percent of respondents had unfavorable views of Palin, while 44percent saw her favorably. A month earlier, 54 percent had seen herfavorably and 32 percent viewed her negatively. Typically,post-election polls find that vice-presidential choices sway about 1percent of voters. This time, Kohut said, "we'll get a much biggernumber." A key reason is that "the Palin choice reflects poorlyon Senator McCain's judgment," said vice presidential expert JoelGoldstein, a professor of law at St. Louis University. Pew foundthat 41 percent of respondents thought McCain showed "poor judgment"overall, while 29 percent said that of Democratic nominee Barack Obama.While McCain's number isn't solely because of his choice of Palin, herselection was a factor. McCain's age is also a reason for voters'concern about Palin. The Arizona senator is 72 and has had fourinstances of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. MayoClinic physicians have posted a detailed explanation of McCain'scondition and treatment on his Web site. The prognosis, they said, was"good." Worries linger, however. "If something happened toMcCain, she would not be qualified to step in and be president," saidAnnette Barron, an independent voter from Altamonte Springs, Fla. Palinalso has hurt herself by becoming largely invisible to the generalpublic, except when she got media attention for starting controversies- such as charging that Obama was "palling around with terrorists" - orfor receiving $150,000 in clothing and accessories from the RepublicanParty. She also unabashedly identifies herself with the party's conservative wing, alienating moderates. "Itreinforced the notion that John McCain cared little about people likeme," said former Maine state Rep. Sherry Huber, a Republican who backedMcCain in the primary but now supports Obama. "She clearly does notshare the values I and other moderate Republicans do." ProminentRepublicans have echoed that idea. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one ofMcCain's closest friends, suggested that Sen. Joseph Lieberman, anindependent Democrat from Connecticut, would have brought independentsto the ticket. Last week, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said thathad McCain picked him, the Republican Party would have had a bettershot at winning his state. Then there's Palin's image problembecause of what vice-presidential expert Timothy Walch called "thealbatross of American comedy." "Every time (comedian) Tina Feyappeared on TV imitating her, it diminished Palin," said Walch, thedirector of the Herbert Hoover presidential library. "For somebodyessentially unknown, she's diminished when she becomes a caricature ofherself." In most election years, Palin would have been afootnote, like controversial vice-presidential choices Spiro Agnew in1968 or Dan Quayle 20 years later. Both were lightly regarded buttriumphed on winning tickets. However, Goldstein, of St. LouisUniversity, noted that in 1968, Richard Nixon was 55, so the prospectof an Agnew presidency seemed dim. In 1988, Quayle ran with George H.W.Bush, who was essentially running for President Reagan's third termagainst unpopular Democrat Michael Dukakis. In 2008, Goldsteinsaid, Obama "has convinced a broad cross-section of the American peoplehe's presidential," so Palin gives swing voters who are warming to theIllinois senator one more reason to move away from McCain. As forPalin's expected appeal to women, Sieglinde Warren, a teachingsupervisor from Poland, Ohio, was a Clinton supporter who now backsObama. Palin and Clinton don't compare, she said, because "Clinton hadsome substance I could relate to." (EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM) Tobe sure, Palin has had some positive impact on the campaign. McCain hadnever been a favorite of strict conservatives, as he challengedRepublican orthodoxy over the years on tax cuts, campaign finance,climate change and other topics. The Republican base loves Palin. "Somany people can relate to her. She really appeals to everydayhousewives, people who go out and hunt, and people who have done greatthings in their life," said Bob Dodge, a retired communicationsengineer in Sarasota, Fla. And don't tell Jennifer Tarman, aBradenton, Fla., medical assistant, that Palin, who's been a governorsince December 2006, isn't qualified. "She's more qualified thanObama," she said. Obama's been a U.S. senator since January 2005, buthas spent most of the past two years campaigning for the White House. Still, the experts and a lot of swing voters agree with Goldstein. "She's made it much more difficult for McCain," he said.

Obama is a revolution that empowers people, dreams, and ideas. you could google it, but heres a ccouple  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/joe-biden?page=3 --biden  reports of palin's IQ seem to vary reasonably between 113 and 133 so google itand find whatever you need Well, rainbows and unicorns, then.  If only conservatives were smarter ;-)What future for your children.More dependance upon someone else?Hope is not a handout.Do you think your great great grandparents went through torture and beatings fighting for the oppurtunities you have had in front of you just to give them back.All you seen was color and some promise of gimme gimme.And tell me something,if life has been so bad,how did he do it?With all the successful black people that have come before him, who refused to give up their seat,who refused to be denied,who worked and busted their ass for you,now,you feel like your free.You can succeed?How have all these black people succeed before Obama?And who has told you you can't?Your so called black leaders,who have told you that you can't,white rich liberals that pander to you,telling you that your a victim.Why was'nt Barack a victim?Was it his white half that succeeded in the skin of a "black man"? It's amazing,everything our ancestors went through only for the majority of us to never see their accomplishments.The freedom they died for,the rights we have had and took for granted.It is another sad day when we reward failure.   IQ's are subjective...no academic institution accepts IQ as a measure of intelligence. How about the ability to discribe the duties of the job you are asking for?Yes Now that dog does not have to be killed!!!!!!  Ignorance Ã¢â°Â  dumb. In all fairness to Palin, she had a few months to sell the American people. Obama has had 2 years. She kind of half answered the elementary school kid by saying that the VP is the leader of the Senate. I didn't expect her to get into particulars with a kid.

0 This is actually a really good thread, I hope it gets some responses. I was thinking this exact same thing today.  The conversational limbo that probably exists in young black republican circles today has got to be pretty loud.Black republicans? You'll have better luck finding a black leprechaun.  They exist. They usually have sticks up their asses, so theyre not too hard to spot.How many black republicans did you think would respond?I'm a Black Republican who DID vote for Obama and I couldn't be happier !!  x2  LOL..I wouldn't expect to find a whole lot of Republicans of any race today.  I guess some guy saw a post I left somewhere, because he was trying very hard to recruit me.  Hit my in box with whole bunch of links, and tried to get all buddy buddy talking about video games.  I lean to the right on a lot of issues (mostly financial, not the cultural stuff) but I have never given it any serious consideration.  No you're not...a black republican that is.  Good for you!! What made you decide to vote for him?

What made you decide to vote for him?  That's funny...lol "black leprechaun"..But trust me, there are some out there. Just ask Fox News. And besides, one of the local news channels was able to find one when they went to the local Republican Party watch Party last night. They asked this one black guy who claimed to be Republican how he felt and he said that he was sad but that "it is what it is..." I wish I could find him and ask him how he really feels...

In her own words, the discomfort of having an unqualified President far outweighs the cultural achievment of America having elected the first black President. She also said the fact that American's are making such a huge deal about his race only makes her less impressed with the accomplishment.  She said when we have a black President that isn't constantly refered to as the First Black President then they will be more pride in the accomplishment.

She is only saying this because he is not republican or conservative. If it had been Colin Powell (who was being heavily recruited) would she be more impressed? But the media would still make a big deal of his race, because it is historic, regardless of what Party the person comes from....I always laugh when people say they want us to live in a color-blind society: the fact is that people do see color, the question is can you be mature enough to not let it cloud your judgment? The fact that race did not play a huge fact in this election is testament to how far we have come....

This was a conversation we had about a month ago, and I haven't talked to her since the results were official, but I would image her opinion is still the same.  We were in a mall and this guy stopped us (i was her and a white guy that had an obama shirt on) and he asked us what basically the same question you did, and that's how you answered.  I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.  IDK, I'm more looking forward to the change he'll bring than his color though.

I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.  IDK, I'm more looking forward to the change he'll bring than his color though.  Why did you stop with Barack X? You forgot the Barack Hussein Obama. I cannot get over thehuge irony that here we are in a war with Islamo-fascists and we elect a president named Barack Hussein Obama. hahahahaha. I love it...  I'm not a republican, she is.   but race did play a huge part in this election for a lot of people (whether it be for positive or negative reasons). i understand his friend's mentality.  it will definitely be historical and it is certainly something to be proud of, but it was not the first step and it should not be the last.  the real accomplishment will be the day that an african-american, female, asian, gay, atheist, muslim, (ect) president is not considered a change.  this wouldn't mean we are color-blind, it would mean we are finally accepting.
0   When McCain 2008 turned out to be a shadow of McCain 2004 AND his pick Sarah Palin. Some of Obama's policy ideas appeal to me and the way he ran his campaign showed REAL LEADERSHIP  yeah...i'm a republican and i voted for obama. i'm just sayin is anyone not sick of the same thing? try something new. don't be afraid to step outside the box. Obama is going to do great things. you and your "friend" will see.  Her argument is very bogus. How can one not make a big deal about him being the first black president. She is only saying this because he is not republican or conservative. If it had been Colin Powell (who was being heavily recruited) would she be more impressed? But the media would still make a big deal of his race, because it is historic, regardless of what Party the person comes from....I always laugh when people say they want us to live in a color-blind society: the fact is that people do see color, the question is can you be mature enough to not let it cloud your judgment? The fact that race did not play a huge fact in this election is testament to how far we have come....  Interesting. I think Palin hurt McCain a little bit and it was sad to see McCain pander to the base of his party, but I think more than anything else it was the failures of George W. Bush that got Obama elected..   I seriously doubt Barack X will do anything "GREAT".  His election will only be "HISTORIC" cause hes black.  and this thread proves it.

I voted for McCain not because of race, so don't act like people who didn't vote for Barack are not mature enough. I have heard two of my best friends (african americans) tell me they were voting for Barack because he is black. Is that not racist? Could I say I voted for McCain because he is white?? We got in many arguements about this but still remain friends because we dont spew hate at each other but intellectual differences. We definately not living in color blind society. Hell I just got done listening to Al Sharpton continue to live in a race based society. He is not savior on black issues, but a problem. My friends even said that Al Sharpton does not speak for them and shouldn't speak for every african american.

I wave the B.S flag.    to be 100 percent honest, I was never a huge McCaing supporter either. I just thought that some of Obama policies were terrible for our country. It has nothing to do with him, but rather the policies and beliefs that his party. Saying that, I think we can both agree that there is no perfect candidate for president. Every American has a view of what their perfect president would be and they all differ. I am wholeheartedly rooting for America to pick itself up and get this country going, but this blaming the problem on republicans or democrats is illogical.  I am happy that people can elect a black president I just wish his policies aligned with my views. Oh well, in all reality, I am still going to finish college, keep working, and the president cannot control that. I am only going to worry about what I can control which is my own life.

Thats why his spiritual mentor, quotes Malcolm X, and hangs out with Louis Farrakahn.  Hes no christian.    I agree that race should not play a role. I voted for McCain not because of race, so don't act like people who didn't vote for Barack are not mature enough. I have heard two of my best friends (african americans) tell me they were voting for Barack because he is black. Is that not racist? Could I say I voted for McCain because he is white?? We got in many arguements about this but still remain friends because we dont spew hate at each other but intellectual differences. We definately not living in color blind society. Hell I just got done listening to Al Sharpton continue to live in a race based society. He is not savior on black issues, but a problem. My friends even said that Al Sharpton does not speak for them and shouldn't speak for every african american.  Well, you are entitled to your opinion. But need I remind you, your argument assumes that all Christians are saints and all Muslims are demons, and that in of itself is not true..  I agree, voting for Obama because he is black and ONLY for that reason is dumb. My reasoning was more along the lines of how Colin Powell came to his conclusion. I honestly do like John McCain and I really hate that his campaign took the turn that he did and he ceased being the 2000 maverick that he once was. His speech last night reminded me of the John McCain that many people love..   You said that not me. I never said anything of the kind.  I know plenty of Muslims, and they think Farakahn and Wright are a coupla nut bags. They voted for McCain by the way.  One family owns 2 liquor stores and a gas station and theyve only lived in this country for 10 years. This was thier first US election as voting citizens.  They really thought Americans were gonna kill them after 9/11, and they live in Massachusetts. They pulled thier children outta school cause the other school kids were pretty mean.   The President of the United States, is the most powerful man on the planet.  He can erase, COUNTRIES, with a word.  Im just glad Barack X has so much experience.  Now I know, I can trust him.   black republicans?  you could say republicans. You are as much of a Republican as I am a Democrat. I wave the B.S flag.    to be 100 percent honest, I was never a huge McCaing supporter either. I just thought that some of Obama policies were terrible for our country. It has nothing to do with him, but rather the policies and beliefs that his party. Saying that, I think we can both agree that there is no perfect candidate for president. Every American has a view of what their perfect president would be and they all differ. I am wholeheartedly rooting for America to pick itself up and get this country going, but this blaming the problem on republicans or democrats is illogical.  I am happy that people can elect a black president I just wish his policies aligned with my views. Oh well, in all reality, I am still going to finish college, keep working, and the president cannot control that. I am only going to worry about what I can control which is my own life.i woud also like to add that no matter what we say here...... Barack Obama is our next prez. If you don't like it you can always leave :-)
